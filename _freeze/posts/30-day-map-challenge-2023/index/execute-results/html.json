Each day of the challenge is associated with a specific theme or prompt, ranging from traditional cartography topics to more unconventional and imaginative ideas. The challenge not only fosters skill development but also builds a sense of community among mapmakers who share their unique perspectives through the maps they create.\n\n![Here are daily prompts for 2023.
