Each day of the challenge is associated with a specific theme or prompt, ranging from traditional cartography topics to more unconventional and imaginative ideas.\n\nThe challenge not only fosters skill development but also builds a sense of community among mapmakers who share their unique perspectives through the maps they create. **TL;DR - maps are neat!**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Here are the prompts for each day of the challenge.
