::: {#about-id}

#### A Little About Me...

I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform **landscape** and **endangered resource conservation**. I will be pursing a Masters in Geography starting fall 2023, so please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you would like to collaborate on my thesis work.

#### Exploring My Creations...

This site contains my **professional portfolio** and **technical blog** to showcase my work in ecological and geospatial science. Please have a look around this site or peruse my [CV](about.qmd) to learn about my endeavors.
