### My Biography

I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to research and inform natural resource conservation.

I currently serve as the **Assistant Wildlife Diversity Coordinator** for the Missouri Department of Conservation. My main duties revolve around implementing the Missouri Bat Habitat Conservation Plan to help conserve imperiled bat species.

In fall 2023, I will be pursuing my **Masters in Geography** at the University of Missouri. I plan to provide updates on my thesis work as that progresses. Please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you have any inquires or would like to collaborate on any ecological or geospatial projects.
