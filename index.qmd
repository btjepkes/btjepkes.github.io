::: {#about-id}

I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform **landscape and endangered resource conservation**. In my current role, I serve as the Assistant Wildlife Diversity Coordinator for the Missouri Department of Conservation. Have a look around to explore my past and current work.
