## About Me {.h2-index}

::: {.index-intro-start}

::: {.index-intro-start-text}

I am a **graduate student** at **the University of Missouri** studying geographic information systems in the Department of Geography. My work focuses on using a variety of **data science** and **geospatial technologies** to research the natural world, often aimed at conservation. I have several years of continuous professional development working with governmental, private, and academic entities across the US.
