#### Hello there,
# My name is Benjamin Tjepkes and this is my professional portfolio.

I'm an experienced wildlife ecologist and geography graduate student with a focus on applied geospatial and conservation science.

<!-- I recently started my **Masters Degree** within the [Geography Department](https://geography.missouri.edu/) at the University of Missouri. I am in the process of developing my thesis project, so stay tuned for more. Please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you would like to collaborate on any geospatial projects. -->

<!-- I am excited to have registered for the **Posit 2023 Conference** in September, where I will be attending virtually. Looking forward to learning more about open source data science. More info on posit::conf(2023) [here](https://posit.co/conference/). -->

I am a **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to research the natural world. I have over 7 years of progressive experience with governmental, private, and academic entities in the **conservation and environmental science** sector.

Whether in a professional setting, during my academic pursuits, or through personal exploration, I consistently engage in a process of ongoing learning. I have actively pursued various independent educational modules aimed at **enhancing my proficiency** in the geospatial, ecological, and analytical sciences. See how I use these skills [here](gallery.qmd) or read about them [here](posts.qmd).

My day-to-day work often involves deep dives into data and data wrangling, so I try to make some fun visuals when given the opportunity. Most of my creative workflows involve time in ArcGIS Pro, R/RStudio, QGIS, or Python/Jupyter Notebooks. When I have time, I like to participate in social media challenges, like MapPromptMonday and TidyTuesday. Find the entirety of my gallery [here](gallery.qmd).
