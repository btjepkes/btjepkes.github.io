#### Wildlife Ecologist & Geographer
# Integrating data science and geospatial to understand nature.

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Ben, an experienced wildlife ecologist and geography graduate student studying geospatial and conservation science.

**August 2023** -- I recently started my Masters Degree within the [Geography Department](https://geography.missouri.edu/) at the University of Missouri with a focus on biogeography and geographic information systems. I am currently in the process of developing my thesis project. Please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you would like to collaborate on geospatial research related to climate change, landscape ecology, or biogeography.

**July 2023** -- I am excited to have registered for [Posit 2023 Conference](https://posit.co/conference/), where I will be attending virtually. Looking forward to learning more about open source data science and how I can expand my work in Python and R. Also, one of my latest maps, *Stamped in History: 50 Years of Imperiled Species Conservation*, recently won 2nd place in the GIS Certification Institute (GISCI) [2023 Map Contest](https://www.gisci.org/News/Issues-News-Policy/gisci-announces-2023-map-contest-winners) within the Professional category.
