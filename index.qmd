Hello, my name is Ben Tjepkes and this is my professional portfolio and technical blog site showcasing my work in ecology and geospatial.

I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform landscape and endangered resource conservation.
