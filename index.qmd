## My Current Role

I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri studying geographic information systems in the Department of Geography. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to conduct research in ecology and biogeography. My [professional CV](curriculum-vitae/index.qmd) has a comprehensive look at my experience.

<!-- ## My Professional Path -->

<!-- ### 01 | Trained as a biologist. {.intro-heading} -->

<!-- My professional career is based in **wildlife ecology and management**, which has been my home discipline for over seven years. Throughout my career, I have undertaken numerous research and management projects that centered on the study and conservation of wildlife and their habitats. -->

<!-- My passion for this field was ignited during my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree. Additionally, I completed several internships, independent projects, and technician experiences, which I pursued during summers and part-time throughout the academic year. -->

<!-- ### 02 | Drawn to geospatial. {.intro-heading} -->

<!-- As I delved further into my wildlife career, I came to the realization that location served as a crucial factor linking the majority of ecological data. This insight sparked my interest in **spatial ecology and geospatial technologies**, which captivated me with their intriguing possibilities. I became deeply fascinated by the study of spatial relationships between organisms and their environment, and by the use of cutting-edge tools to map and analyze these relationships. -->

<!-- Driven by my growing fascination with geospatial technologies, I sought out opportunities to learn and apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in my conservation work. I enrolled in specialized courses and workshops to acquire proficiency in GIS software and its application in conservation planning, landscape ecology, and wildlife management. -->

<!-- ### 03 | Mastering geography. {.intro-heading} -->

<!-- With a fervent desire to deepen my knowledge of the fundamental principles of geography, I am thrilled to announce my pursuit of a **Master's degree in Geography** at the University of Missouri. This exciting opportunity presents me with the chance to delve into the underlying spatial theory that informs the cutting-edge techniques that I have employed in my ecological studies. -->

<!-- Through my Master's program, I have the opportunity to study a broad range of topics spanning physical, human, and environmental geography. My goal is to synthesize my practical experience in wildlife ecology with the theoretical concepts gained in my Master's program. -->
