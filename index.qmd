## My Brief Bio

I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri studying geographic information systems in the Department of Geography. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to conduct research in ecology and biogeography. My interests span the fields of geospatial, ecology, data science, and climate science.
