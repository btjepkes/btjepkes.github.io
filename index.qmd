I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform landscape and endangered resource conservation.

Through this website, you can discover how I leverage the power of data and geospatial technologies to conduct thorough analyses, produce compelling visualizations, and communicate critical information through reports, figures, and maps. I take great pride in my ability to bridge the gap between scientific research and practical conservation efforts.
