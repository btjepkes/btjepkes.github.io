## Welcome to my Portfolio

This site contains my **professional portfolio** and **technical blog** to showcase my work in ecological and geospatial science. Please have a look around this site or peruse my [CV](about.qmd) to learn about my past and current endeavors. Thank you for stopping by!


::: {#about-id}

<span style="color: #f55c5c; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">My Biography</span> --- I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform **landscape** and **endangered resource conservation**. In my current role, I serve as the Assistant Wildlife Diversity Coordinator for the Missouri Department of Conservation. I will be pursing a Masters in Geography starting fall 2023, so please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you would like to collaborate on a geospatial project.
