::: {#about-id}

Hi, my name is Ben Tjepkes and I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform landscape and endangered resource conservation. Have a look around this site to explore my past and current work.

## Trained as a biologist. {.intro-heading}

My professional background is based in wildlife ecology and management, where I spent the past 7+ years building my career. During this time, I worked on a variety of projects researching and managing wildlife and their habitats.

## Drawn to geospatial. {.intro-heading}

As I advanced in my wildlife career, I began to recognize that location was a linking factor for nearly all ecological data. This realization developed into a fascination in spatial ecology and geospatial technologies.

## Embracing geography. {.intro-heading}

I will be pursuing my Masters in Geography beginning fall 2023.
