#### Hello there,
# My name is Benjamin Tjepkes and this is *meum portfolium*.

Experienced in ecology, delving into geography, and actively practicing geospatial -- my passion lies in the realm of applied science.

#### My latest annoucements. {.index-h4}

:::{.index-list}
I recently started my **Masters Degree** within the [Geography Department](https://geography.missouri.edu/) at the University of Missouri. I am in the process of developing my thesis project, so stay tuned for more. Please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you have any inquires or would like to collaborate on any ecological or geospatial projects.

My next conference will be the **Posit Conference** in September 2023, where I will be attending virtually. More info on [posit::conf(2023)](https://posit.co/conference/).

#### Dedicated to applied science. {.index-h4}

:::{.index-list}

I am a **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to research the natural world. I have over 7 years of progressive experience with governmental, private, and academic entities in the **conservation and environmental science** sector.

#### Dedicated to lifelong learning. {.index-h4}

:::{.index-list}

Whether in a professional setting, during my academic pursuits, or through personal exploration, I consistently engage in a process of ongoing learning. I have actively pursued various independent educational modules aimed at **enhancing my proficiency** in the geospatial, ecological, and analytical sciences. See how I use these skills [here](gallery.qmd) or read about them [here](posts.qmd).

My professional work often involves deep dives into data and data wrangling, so I try to make some fun visuals? Most of my creative workflows involve time in ArcGIS Pro, R/RStudio, QGIS, or Python/Jupyter Notebooks. When I have time, I like to participate in social media challenges, like MapPromptMonday and TidyTuesday. Find the entirety of my gallery [here](gallery.qmd).
