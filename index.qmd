<span style="color: #f55c5c; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">My Biography</span> --- I am a dedicated **wildlife ecologist** and **geospatial practitioner** interested in advancing the science behind natural resource conservation. My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform **landscape** and **endangered resource conservation**. In my current role, I serve as the Assistant Wildlife Diversity Coordinator for the Missouri Department of Conservation. Peruse this site or my [CV](about.qmd) to learn more about my work.
