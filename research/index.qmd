### My Research Geography

I am fortunate to have worked extensively across the Midwestern United States on a diversity of projects. The map below displays my research influence across this region where I have conducted research.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(leaflet)
library(sf)

sites <- sf::st_read("features_for_website.geojson", quiet = TRUE)

bbox <- sf::st_bbox(sites)

leaflet(sites, options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 5)) |> 
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.HOT) |> 
  addPolygons(label = ~as.character(Name),
              labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = FALSE,
                                          direction = "bottom"),
              color = "red") |> 
  setMaxBounds(lng1 = -125.69159, lat1 = 24.33702,
               lng2 = -63.43924, lat2 = 50.50496)
```
