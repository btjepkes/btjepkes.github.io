description: "This undergraduate research project was aimed at assessing the need for beaver flow devices for water control strutures owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. From these results, I designed a specialized flow device (i.e., the **Tjepkes Beaver Reliever**) for the structures most impacted by beavers in the study area."
