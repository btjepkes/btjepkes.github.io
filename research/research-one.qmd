abstract: "This undergraduate research project involved cleaning and analyzing bald eagle nesting records from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with the goal of determining how individuals of the Upper Mississippi River bald eagle population are selecting nest sites. We used a mixed-effects resource selection function under a use-availability design to understand the environmental features important to breeding pairs of bald eagles when selecting locations to establish nest sites."
