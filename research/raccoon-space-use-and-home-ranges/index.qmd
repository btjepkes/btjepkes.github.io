## Project Objectives & Methods

This undergraduate research project looked at space-use and home range size differences between male and female raccoons across an urban-rural gradient in Laramie, Wyoming. Location data were collected from radio-marked raccoons using vehicle-mounted and handheld VHF telemetry throughout the year. Homerange estimates (MCPs) were generated using the `adehabitatHR` package in the RStudio environment.
