## The Tools in my Toolbox

Like any good handy person, my toolbox contains a variety of tools that I can use for their intended purpose. *Though I have hammered with a wrench in a pinch.* I think it is quite exciting to experiment with software and programming packages to adapt my workflows through time. 

Here are some of my favorite programs and software that I use almost every day:

- **GIS & Spatial Analysis** --- ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and RStudio

- **Writing & Reporting** --- R Markdown, Quarto, and MS Word

- **Data Management** --- RStudio, Excel, Access, and MySQL

- **Data Visualizations** --- RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks

- **Web Development** --- Notion, Super, VSCode, and WordPress


## Data Viz and Reports

This will be data visualizations and report examples.


## GIS and Mapping

The following projects are my creations using various GIS software. The bulk of my maps were created within the ArcGIS environment, but I have been expanding into the R-based spatial world.

## Blogging & Writings

Since around 2021, I have been running a personal blog called [The Conservation Companion](https://conservationcompanion.com), which contains posts on ecology, the natural sciences, and anything else I can think of. This space has been an excellent area for me to grow my writing and coding (HTML/CSS) skills.

**Here are some of my recent blog posts:**

- [How Scientists Use GIS to Study Wildlife](https://conservationcompanion.com/blog/how-scientists-use-gis-to-study-wildlife)

- [How to Become a Contemporary Naturalist](https://conservationcompanion.com/blog/how-to-become-a-contemporary-naturalist)

- [Job Boards To Find An Impactful Career in Nature](https://conservationcompanion.com/blog/job-boards-to-find-an-impactful-career-in-nature)
