## The Tools in my Toolbox

Like any good handy person, my toolbox contains a variety of tools that I can use for their intended purpose. *Though sometimes I do hammer with a wrench from time to time in a pinch.*

Here are some of my favorite programs and software that I use almost every day:

- **GIS** --- ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and RStudio

- **Reporting** --- R Markdown and Quarto

- **Data Visualizations** --- RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks

- **Web Development** --- Notion, Super, VSCode, and WordPress
