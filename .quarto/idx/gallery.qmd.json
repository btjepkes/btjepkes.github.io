The bulk of my maps were created within the ArcGIS environment, but I have been expanding into the R-based spatial world.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"47.5%\"}\n\n![Credit: Ben Tjepkes](img-map-1.jpg)\n\n![Credit: Ben Tjepkes](img-map-4.jpg)\n\n![Credit: Ben Tjepkes](img-map-5.jpg)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"47.5%\"}\n\n![Credit: Ben Tjepkes](img-map-2.jpg)\n\n![Credit: Ben Tjepkes](img-map-3.jpg)\n\n![Credit: Ben Tjepkes](img-map-6.jpg)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Blogging & Writings\n\nSince around 2021, I have been running a personal blog called [The Conservation Companion](https://conservationcompanion.com), which contains posts on ecology, the natural sciences, and anything else I can think of. This space has been an excellent area for me to grow my writing and coding (HTML/CSS) skills.\n\n**Here are some of my recent blog posts:**\n\n- [How Scientists Use GIS to Study Wildlife](https://conservationcompanion.com/blog/how-scientists-use-gis-to-study-wildlife)\n\n- [How to Become a Contemporary Naturalist](https://conservationcompanion.com/blog/how-to-become-a-contemporary-naturalist)\n\n- [Job Boards To Find An Impactful Career in Nature](https://conservationcompanion.com/blog/job-boards-to-find-an-impactful-career-in-nature)\n\n## Nature Photography\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"gallery.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"solar","smooth-scroll":true,"title":"Project Gallery","description":"Peruse my creative creations --- maps, data visualiztions, reports, web development, photography, and writings.","author":"Benjamin Tjepkes","date-modified":"04/11/2023"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
