I became deeply fascinated by the study of spatial relationships between organisms and their environment, and by the use of cutting-edge tools to map and analyze these relationships.\n\nDriven by my growing fascination with geospatial technologies, I sought out opportunities to learn and apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in my conservation work. I enrolled in specialized courses and workshops to acquire proficiency in GIS software and its application in conservation planning, landscape ecology, and wildlife management.

This exciting opportunity presents me with the chance to delve into the underlying spatial theory that informs the cutting-edge techniques that I have employed in my ecological studies.\n\nThrough my Master's program, I will have the opportunity to study a range of topics that span physical, human, and environmental geography, including spatial analysis, remote sensing, and cartography. I am particularly excited to delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of these topics, to analyze complex spatial relationships, and to explore the implications of geographic research for society and the environment. Ultimately, my goal is to synthesize my practical experience in wildlife ecology and management with the theoretical concepts I will gain in my Master's program to continue to advance conservation efforts and contribute to the broader field of geography.\n\n\n## My Professional Travels\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>%\n  addProviderTiles(\"CartoDB.Positron\") %>% \n  addMarkers(lng=-92.286, lat=38.890) %>% \n  setView(lng=-92.286, lat=38.890, zoom = 10)\n```\n\n\n## Photos\n::: {layout=\"[[1, 1], [1]]\"}\n![A Lovely Image](bg-pinecone.jpg){group=\"my-gallery\"}\n\n![Another Lovely Image](img-computer.png){group=\"my-gallery\"}\n\n![The Last Lovely Image](img-data-viz.jpg){group=\"my-gallery\"}\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![A snapshot of my wildlife work.](img-ben-work.png)\n\n\n## 01.
