May 2025\n\n- **B.S., Wildlife Ecology** | University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point | May 2019\n\nMy college coursework expanded into several adjacent topics (e.g., soil science, watershed management, statistics, and forestry) which allows my work to be interdisciplinary.\n \n### Continued Learning\n\nI pride myself on being someone who seeks out continuous learning. Be it at my work or during my free time, I love learning new techniques, workflows, and software.\n\n- **Esri MOOC** (Massive Open Online Courses), including Spatial Data Science and Cartography.\n\n- **LinkedIn Learning**, including a variety of modules on data science, coding in R, and creating maps programmatically.\n\n## Work Experience\n\n### Post-Degree\n\nSince obtaining my degree, I have held a variety of roles within the conservation career space.\n\n- **Assistant Wildlife Diversity Coordinator** | MO Department of Conservation | 08/22--Present\n\n- **Assistant Natural History Biologist** | MO Department of Conservation | 10/19--08/22\n\n- **Biological Science Technician** | Agassiz NWR, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | 05/19--10/19\n\n### Pre-Degree\n\nWhile in college, I gained high-quality research and management experience.\n\n- **Ungulate Ecology Student Teaching Assistant** | UWSP | 01/19--05/19\n\n- **Student Project Assistant** | Wisconsin Center for Wildlife | 12/17--05/19\n\n## Professional Organizations\n\n### The Wildlife Society\n\nThe Wildlife Society (TWS) has been my primary professional organization since my freshman year of college. I have held several leadership roles within TWS during this time.\n\n### Society for Conservation GIS\n\nThe Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS) is a relatively new addition to my professional involvement. I am excited to learn new ways to volunteer with this wonderful organization.\n\n## Connecting with Me\n\nInterested in working on a project together or wondering if I still have the code for a past project?\n\nPlease contact me via [email](mailto:benjamin.tjepkes+websitecontact@gmail.com) or through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamintjepkes/) with any inquiries.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"solar","smooth-scroll":true,"title-block-banner":true,"title":"About Me","subtitle":"I work as a wildlife ecologist and geospatial practitioner to find solutions for researching and conserving our natural resources.","image":"img-ben-with-bear.jpg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
