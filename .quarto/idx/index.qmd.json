My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform landscape and endangered resource conservation. Have a look around this site to explore my past and current work.\n\n:::\n\n::: {#site-listings}\n:::\n\n![](img-ben-work.png)\n\n\nMy professional background is based in wildlife ecology and management, where I spent the past 7+ years building my career. During this time, I worked on a variety of projects researching and managing wildlife and their habitats.\n\n\n## 02. Drawn to geospatial. {.intro-heading}\n\nAs I advanced in my wildlife career, I began to recognize that location was a linking factor for nearly all ecological data. This realization developed into a fascination in spatial ecology and geospatial technologies.\n\n## 03. Exploring geo-science. {.intro-heading}\n\nTo gain a better understanding of geographic thought, I will be pursuing my Masters in Geography in late 2023. This opportunity will allow me to research the underlying spatial theory behind the techniques I have used in ecological studies.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"solar","smooth-scroll":true,"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Benjamin W.
