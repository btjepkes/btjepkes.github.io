My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform landscape and endangered resource conservation. Please explore this site to see my current and past projects.\n\nI will be starting grad school at the University of Missouri -- Columbia in fall 2023. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate on my thesis project or other ancillary work. My interests range from landscape connectivity to GIS application development for conservation.\n\n\n## My Education\n\nMy educational background is primarily in wildlife conservation science along with geographic information systems. My college coursework spread into several adjacent topics (e.g., soil science, watershed management, statistics, and forestry) which allows me to be multidisciplinary.\n\n- **MA, Geography** | University of Missouri-Columbia | Ant. May 2025\n\n- **BS, Wildlife Ecology** | University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point | May 2019\n\n## My Highlights\n\n\n- 7+ years of progressive experience in conservation and environmental science.\n\n- Demonstrated experience with desktop, web, and mobile GIS software (e.g., Esri ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Field Maps).\n\n- Proficient in working with Microsoft Office (e.g., Word, Excel, Access, Publisher, Outlook).\n\n- Working knowledge of R to perform statistical analyses, data wrangling, and data visualization.\n\n- Front-end web development experience using HTML and CSS coding languages.\n\n- Proficient in managing large dataset using standardized software and methods.\n\n- Skillful in cartographic design using open source and proprietary mapping applications.\n\n- Adept at using R Markdown and Quarto for reproducible reporting.\n\n\n## Maps & Data Viz Gallery\n\nFor the last several years, I have been experimenting with cartography and data visualization. Whether for work or play, this has always been an area of excitement for me. The perfect mixture of art and science is where I shine.\n\n## Blogging & Writings\n\nSince around 2021, I have been running a personal blog called [The Conservation Companion](https://conservationcompanion.com), which contains posts on ecology, the natural sciences, and anything else I can think of. This space has been an excellent area for me to grow my writing and coding (HTML/CSS) skills.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"solar","smooth-scroll":true,"title":"Intro & Welcome","description":"Hello, I'm Ben Tjepkes and this is my professional portfolio detailing my career experience, creative projects, and educational pursuits."},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
