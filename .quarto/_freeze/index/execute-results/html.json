My name is **Ben Tjepkes** and I am a dedicated wildlife ecologist and geographer.\n\nThis is my online portfolio showcasing my professional and creative works. I am currently a **graduate student** at the University of Missouri studying **geographic information systems** in the Department of Geography. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to conduct research in **ecology and biogeography**. My interests span the fields of geospatial, ecology, data science, and climate science. Please have a look around at my blog posts, research overviews, visualization gallery, full curriculum vitae, and lots more. \n:::\n\n::: {#site-listings-2 .column-body-outset}\n:::\n\n\n<!-- ## My Brief Bio -->\n\n<!-- I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri studying geographic information systems in the Department of Geography.
