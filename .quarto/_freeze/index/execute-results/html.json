My work focuses on using data science and geospatial techniques to research and inform **landscape** and **endangered resource conservation**. I will be pursing a Masters in Geography starting fall 2023, so please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you would like to collaborate on my thesis work.\n\nThis site contains my **professional portfolio** and **technical blog** to showcase my work in ecological and geospatial science. Please have a look around this site or peruse my [CV](about.qmd) to learn about my endeavors. Thank you for visiting my site!\n:::\n\n\n::: {#site-listings}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
