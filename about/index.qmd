Hello! My name is Benjamin (Ben) Tjepkes and I am a wildlife ecologist and geographer with a passion for conservation data science. I am currently a **graduate student** at the **University of Missouri** studying geographic information systems (GIS) in the Department of Geography. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to conduct research in **ecology and biogeography**. My professional interests (and masters thesis work) revolve around the conservation of nature, especially under the pressures of climate change. I am especially interested in how climate drives interactions, movements, and resource availability across the landscape.

My professional career is based in **wildlife ecology and management**, which has been my home discipline for over seven years. Throughout my career, I have undertaken numerous research and management projects that centered on the study and conservation of wildlife and their habitats. My passion for this field was ignited during my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree. Additionally, I completed several internships, independent projects, and technician experiences during summers and part-time throughout the academic year. After earning my degree, I pursued several wildlife research and management positions that opened my eyes to my true passion of conservation work.


As I delved further into my wildlife career, I came to the realization that location served as a crucial factor linking the majority of ecological data. This insight sparked my interest in **spatial ecology and geospatial technologies**, which captivated me with their intriguing possibilities. I became deeply fascinated by the study of spatial relationships between organisms and their environment, and by the use of cutting-edge tools to map and analyze these relationships. Driven by my growing fascination with geospatial technologies, I sought out opportunities to learn and apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in my conservation work. I enrolled in specialized courses and workshops to acquire proficiency in GIS software and its application in conservation planning, landscape ecology, and wildlife management.

With a fervent desire to deepen my knowledge of the fundamental principles of geography, I am thrilled to announce my pursuit of a **Master's degree in Geography** at the University of Missouri. This exciting opportunity presents me with the chance to delve into the underlying spatial theory that informs the cutting-edge techniques that I have employed in my ecological studies. Through my Master's program, I have the opportunity to study a broad range of topics spanning physical, human, and environmental geography. My goal is to synthesize my practical experience in wildlife ecology with the theoretical concepts gained in my Master's program.
