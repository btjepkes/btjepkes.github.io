## Map Gallery

Many of my professional duties and personal free time are spent exploring the realms of geospatial and cartography. The following are a sampling of my these explorations.

**Tools & Technologies:** ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcMap, R/RStudio, QGIS

::: {#gallery-listings-maps .listings-gallery}
:::

## Data Viz Gallery

In addition to my cartographic pursuits, I like to design the occasional data visualization. These are often based on #TidyTuesday prompts or other projects.

**Tools & Technologies:** R/RStudio, Python/Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel

::: {#gallery-listings-dataviz .listings-gallery}
:::

## Poster & Report Gallery

My most technical, but equally as creative, projects surround the creation of posters and reports. These are often for scientific conferences or other professional venues.

**Tools & Technologies:** R/RStudio, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Publisher, Quarto, RMarkdown
