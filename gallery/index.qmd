## Map Gallery

Many of my professional duties and personal free time are spent exploring the realms of geospatial and cartography. I have always loved maps and creating them provides a creative release for me.

**Tools & Technologies:** ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcMap, R/RStudio, QGIS

## Data Viz Gallery

In addition to my cartographic pursuits, I like to design the occasional data visualization. These are often based on #TidyTuesday prompts, coursework, or other personal and work-related projects.

**Tools & Technologies:** R/RStudio, Python/Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel

## Poster & Report Gallery

My most technical, but equally as creative, projects surround the creation of posters and reports. These are often for scientific conferences or other professional venues.

**Tools & Technologies:** R/RStudio, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Publisher, Quarto, RMarkdown
