## Objectives

This map was my contribution to **Day Six** of the 2023 [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), which prompted "Asia" as the main subject. I knew right away that I was going to be mapping either a threatened wildlife species or a threatened orchid species given this location. I was also wanting an interesting project to work more creatively in RStudio on my programmatic cartography and this fit the bill perfectly.

## Tools & Workflow

Like many of my visualizations in R, I assembled this map using `ggplot` and many ancillary packages. One package that I was happy to use was `arcgisbinding`, which allowed me to easily load in a web feature layer (Tiger Conservation Landscapes from the Esri Living Atlas).

```r
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggspatial)
library(ggtext)
library(showtext)
library(camcorder)
library(arcgisbinding)
```

The historical and current range data were available as a download from the IUCN Red List. These overlapped well with the TCLs, so I decided to handle those as proportional symbols based on their area.

## Final Result
