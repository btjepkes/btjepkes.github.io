## Task & Objectives

The prompt for this map was for Day Two of the 2023 [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), which designated "lines" for the main subject. I had been wanting to work more with contours, so this was the perfect opportunity.

## Tools & Workflow

Data were downloaded from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources GIS hub site, including a 3-meter digital elevation model (DEM) and a general hydrological features layer.

In ArcGIS Pro, the DEM was used to generate a simplified 10-m contour feature class. The lakes and stream features were then added to provide context for the surrounding area.

## Final Result
