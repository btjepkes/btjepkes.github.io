abstract: "This map visualizes shoreline structure setback compliance (in accordance with Wisconsin NR 115.05(1)(b)) for Mud, Penny, and Tree Lakes in Portage County, Wisconsin. All primary structures in each lake-adjacent parcel were outlined using heads-up digitizing techniques. The distance to water was then determined using the Near tool in ArcMap, referencing the ordinary high water mark for compliance."
