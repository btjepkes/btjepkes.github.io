## Task & Objectives

The prompt for this map was for **Day Eight** of the 2023 [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), which designated "Africa" for the main subject. Hyenas have always fascinated me with their complex behavior, clan structure, and hunting abilities. This prompt was a perfect time to explore their ranges!

## Tools & Workflow

Spatial data were sourced from the IUCN for each species. Map was produced in ArcGIS Pro 3.2.

The comprehensive layout options in ArcGIS Pro have always helped me out, but this time it was very simple to link the extents of each sub-map to ensure perfect alignment.

## Final Result

Here is the resulting map series showing each species range across Africa.
