abstract: "This choropleth map was created as a public-facing visualization to show the number of black bear sightings in each Missouri county during 2020. It was featured in the [February 2021 issue of the *Missouri Conservationist*](https://mdc.mo.gov/magazines/missouri-conservationist/2021-02/missouri-black-bears) for an article about Missouri's black bear population. Map creation was performed in ArcGIS Pro. All data came from internally-maintained geodatabases."
