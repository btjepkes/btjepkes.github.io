This figure, inspired by the work of [@nrennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io/), was created for Week 1 of the 2024 TidyTuesday. Data were downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `gh` package in R. Figure production was completed in RStudio with several packages, including `ggplot`, `tidyverse`, and `showtext`. My entire workflow can be found on my project [GH repo](https://github.com/btjepkes/TidyTuesday_2024/tree/main/TT_2024_01). The resulting figure summarizes my **660 commits** in 2023 using a styled visualization replicated from the GitHub activity tracker.
