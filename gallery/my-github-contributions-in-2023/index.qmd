## Task & Objectives

This figure was created for Week 1 of the 2024 TidyTuesday.

## Tools & Workflow

- Data were downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `gh` package in R.
- Figure production was completed in RStudio with several packages, including `ggplot`, `tidyverse`, and `showtext`.
- My entire workflow can be found on my project [GH repo](https://github.com/btjepkes/TidyTuesday_2024/tree/main/TT_2024_01).


## Final Results

Here is the resulting figure summarizing my **660 commits** in 2023.
