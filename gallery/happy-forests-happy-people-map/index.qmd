## Task & Objectives

This map was created for **Day 13** of the 2023 [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), which designated "Choropleth" for the main subject.

## Tools & Workflow

Map creation was performed in ArcGIS Pro. Data were sourced from the U.S. Forest Service and WalletHub.

## Final Result

Here is the final product showing both happiness and forest cover as a bivariate choropleth map.
