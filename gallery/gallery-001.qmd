abstract: "This section showcases maps created for various work-based projects, mostly using ArcGIS Pro and RStudio. These cartographic representations combine technical expertise and creativity to convey information effectively for reports, presentations, or other work-related products. The primary focus of these maps is the visualization of wildlife-related topics, including quantification of species-specific harvests. While many of my GIS applications for wildlife contain protected species information so I cannot share, these shown here contain publicly-available data."
