## Task & Objectives

The prompt for this map was for **Day Nine** of the 2023 [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), which designated "Hexagons" for the main subject.

## Tools & Workflow

Data were downloaded from the National Center for Education Statistics.

## Final Result

Here is the resulting map showing 51 hexbins, one for each state and Washington DC, where the color signifies the number of institutions in that state.
