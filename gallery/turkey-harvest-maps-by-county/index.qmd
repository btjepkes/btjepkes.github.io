abstract: These maps were produced as public-facing visualizations for presentations by the Turkey and Grouse Program with the Missouri Department of Conservation. They show turkey harvest density within each Missouri county for the fall 2021 and spring 2022 seasons. Harvest data were pulled from internal databases and prepped using `tidyverse` operations in R. Map creation was completed in ArcGIS Pro 2.9.
