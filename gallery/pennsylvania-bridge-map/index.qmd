## Task & Objectives

This map was created for **Day 15** of the 2023 [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), which designated "Open Street Map" for the main subject. The resulting map shows locations (points in green) of all bridges in PA based on the OpenStreetMap database.

## Tools & Workflow

Map creation was performed in R/Studio using the`ggplot` package.

OpenStreeMap data for both bridges and largest cities were accessed via the `osmdata` package.
