## Overview

This map series was created as part of my advanced GIS course final project. I used bird feeder visitation data from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/) to develop a map series showing the spatial distribution of observations in each major U.S. metro area. The main tools used for this project were ArcGIS Pro and Python, specifically `arcpy`.

## Data

**2020 U.S. Census Urban Areas**

To represent urban spaces for our exploration, we will use the 2020 U.S. Census designated urban boundaries. The definition used by the Census is "an urban area will comprise a densely settled core of census blocks that meet minimum housing unit density and/or population density requirements". The U.S. Census and Esri maintain an ArcGIS Feature Service for this layer, which can be queried at: USA Census Urban Areas.

**FeederWatch Bird Observation Data**

To represent bird species occurence for our exploration, we will use the 2021-2023 dataset from Project FeederWatch. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology maintains raw data downloads available in .csv format at https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/. Data for this project were downloaded directly from the "checklist data 2021-2023" link under RAW DATA ACCESS.

## Workflow

**Setup & Configuration**

1. Import Modules & Set Environmental Settings
1. Loading & Filtering U.S. Urban Areas
1. Loading & Filtering Bird Observation Data

**Geoprocessing**

1. Reprojection & Feature Layers
1. Cluster & Outlier Detection
1. Standard Deviational Ellipse Development

**Map Generation**

1. Mapping Folder & Layer Configuration
1. Iterative Map Production

## Final Result

Here is the resulting product, a PDF map series with consistent styling and symbology. The full notebook, which outlines the complete methods and steps performed, can be found in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/btjepkes/mu-geog-7940/). I am excited to build upon this workflow to develop automated techniques of map creation for other projects as well.
