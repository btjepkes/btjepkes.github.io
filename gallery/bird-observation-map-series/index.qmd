## Overview

This map series was created as part of my advanced GIS course final project. I used bird feeder visitation data from Project FeederWatch to develop a map series showing the spatial distribution of observations in each major U.S. metro area. The main tools used for this project were ArcGIS Pro and Python, specifically `arcpy`.

## Final Result

Here is the resulting product, a PDF map series with consistent styling and symbology. The full notebook, which outlines the complete methods and steps performed, can be found in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/btjepkes/mu-geog-7940/).
