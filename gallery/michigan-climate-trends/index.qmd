## Task & Objectives

The assignment for this exploration was to investigate climate (i.e., precipitation and temperature) trends for somewhere you want to live. I chose the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

## Tools & Workflow

- Data were downloaded from [PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/).
- Figure production was completed in RStudio with several packages: `ggplot` and `tidyverse`.


## Final Results

Here is the first figure showing trends in **precipitation**.
