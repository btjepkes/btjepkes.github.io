description: "This exploration was part of a recent class assignment where I was tasked to develop a historic climate profile for a location I would like to live in the future. I picked the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for my location due to its regionally unique biogeography. I sourced PRISM climate data and built some climate charts."

## Task & Objectives

The assignment for this exploration was to investigate climate (i.e., precipitation and temperature) trends for somewhere you want to live. I chose the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

## Tools & Workflow

- Data were downloaded from [PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/).
- Figure production was completed in RStudio with several packages: `ggplot` and `tidyverse`.


## Final Results

Here are the resulting figures showing trends in precipitation and temperature for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan over the last ~100 years.
