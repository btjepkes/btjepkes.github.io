## Introduction

I recently wrapped up my first spring semester as a graduate student, making my list of college courses taken surpass 70! As the bags under my eyes can tell you, it has been a long road to this point, with much still left to go. I wanted to take some time to look back and reflect on the courses I have experienced in my higher education journey thus far.

### Archiving Course Descriptions

The primary instigator of this was that I was finally able to finish assembling my spreadsheet of courses over my career. Why collect these? Well, I am in the process of submitting my application for various professional certifications and many of them require a record of all courses taken that apply to their certification. For example, my application for [The Wildlife Society Certification Program](https://wildlife.org/certification-programs/) is one I have been planning for a long time.

## Workflow

The steps I took for this process came largely from [this blog post](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/text-mining-and-word-cloud-fundamentals-in-r-5-simple-steps-you-should-know), which was extremely helpful in understanding these text mining packages in R.

### Data Processing

```r
# Install ----
install.packages("tm")  # for text mining
install.packages("SnowballC") # for text stemming
install.packages("wordcloud") # word-cloud generator 
install.packages("RColorBrewer") # color palettes

# Load ----
library("tm")
library("SnowballC")
library("wordcloud")
library("RColorBrewer")

# Load the text
text <- base::readLines(file.choose())


# Load the data as a corpus
docs <- tm::Corpus(VectorSource(text))


# Text transformation ----
toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, "/")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, "@")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, "\\|")

# Text cleaning ----

# Convert the text to lower case
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Remove numbers
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Remove english common stopwords
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
# Remove your own stop word
# specify your stopwords as a character vector
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c("course", "will")) 
# Remove punctuations
docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
# Eliminate extra white spaces
docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)


# Build a Term-Document Matrix ----
dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
head(d, 10)

# Create and save word cloud
set.seed(1234)
grDevices::png(filename = "./word_plot.png",
               width = 1000,
               height = 1000,
               units = "px",
               res = 150)
wordcloud::wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
grDevices::dev.off()

```
