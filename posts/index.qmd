abstract: "This page is the home to all my writings. In general, they come in two flavors â€“ technical writing and conservation writing. The former covers some of my adventures whilst learning to become a multi-lingual user in R, Python, SQL, and beyond. The latter is more creative in nature, coming mostly from my former site The Conservation Companion."

## TCC Archive

One of my personal projects over the last several years was the development of a conservation-focused blog called, **The Conservation Companion**. While I am continuing to develop content for TCC when I can, I was unable to maintain the web hosting service since starting grad school.

*Most of those posts are archived here for the time being.*
