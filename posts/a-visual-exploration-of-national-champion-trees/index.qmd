## Introduction

### National Champion Trees Program

The National Champion Trees Program is a remarkable initiative in the United States aimed at identifying, documenting, and celebrating the largest and most extraordinary trees in the country. Led by organizations such as the **American Forests** and the **Arbor Day Foundation**, this program involves passionate tree enthusiasts and arborists who meticulously measure and evaluate trees of various species across the nation.

By maintaining a national register of **champion trees**, the program highlights the exceptional size and importance of these arboreal wonders. It not only showcases the natural beauty and biodiversity of America but also fosters awareness and conservation efforts to protect these magnificent living treasures for future generations.

### Data Sources

- **Champion Trees** -- The data referenced for this post are pulled from the 2021 registry of champion trees, which I sourced from the American Forests website as a PDF document. This was the most recent version available at the time I am writing this post. The hosting organization is in the process of re-homing the registry, as outlined in this [letter](https://d3f9k0n15ckvhe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sept-9-2022-Champion-Trees-update.pdf), so I am unsure how long the data will remain at this location.

- **Reference Trees** -- The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database served as my reference data [source](https://www.fia.fs.usda.gov/tools-data/). This program of the U.S. Forest Service provides the information needed to assess America's forests, including metrics also archived in champion tree registry (e.g., diameter).
