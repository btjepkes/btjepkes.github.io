## Introduction

Earlier this academic semester, I was able to help develop and host a technical workshop, "GIS for Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences". While I have helped with many GIS training sessions in the past, this was my first time taking the lead on development from start to end. I figured this was a perfect opportunity to test the use of a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) site that would allow me to have all content in one place during and after the workshop.

## The Result

The functioning website can be found [here](https://btjepkes.github.io/WAFSGSO_2024_GIS/) and includes all the required data downloads.
