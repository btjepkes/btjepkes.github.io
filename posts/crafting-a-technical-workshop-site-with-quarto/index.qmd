## Introduction

![](img-layer-stack.png){.quarto-cover-image}

Earlier this academic semester, I was able to help develop and host a technical workshop for the wildlife and fisheries graduate student organization on campus. While I have helped with many GIS training sessions in the past, this was my first time taking the lead on development from start to end. I figured this was a perfect opportunity to test the use of a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) site that would allow me to have all content in one place during and after the workshop.

The workshop, which was aptly named *GIS for Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences*, covered the basics of geographic information systems and several methods of programmatically doing spatial work with ArcGIS Pro, Python, and R.

## Logistics & Content

The functioning website can be found [here](https://btjepkes.github.io/WAFSGSO_2024_GIS/){target="_blank"} and includes all the required data downloads. The interface (@fig-screenshot-site) is setup as a general website with multiple pages for slides, topics, and resources.

## Final Thoughts

This workshop seemed very well-received and I plan on offering this workshop(s) again.
