## Background

### Learning Outcomes

In today's data-driven world, reporting and communicating data insights play a vital role in decision-making processes. However, manual updates and formatting can be time-consuming introduce a plethora of errors. By adopting reproducible practices, you can save time, increase efficiency, and ensure the accuracy of your reports. Our learning outcomes for this post include the following:

- Learn how to use Quarto documents within the RStudio environment.
- Learn how to load in TidyTuesday data using a dedicated R package.
- Learn how to make basic visualizations and maps.

### What is Quarto?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source document framework built for reproducibility. It integrates seamlessly with RStudio, allowing you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document or project (like this website). With Quarto, you can automate the process of report generation, making it easier to update and reproduce documents as your data or analysis changes.

### Data Sources

The data set we will be working with in this post was discovered through the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data visualization challenge. Specifically, we will focus on bird feeder visitation data from the [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/). This is a Cornell Lab of Ornithology initiative that utilizes data submitted by citizen scientists across the United States.

## Workflow

To demonstrate how Quarto can streamline your reporting workflow, let's work with birdfeeder visitation data from FeederWatch. We will parameterize our reports to automatically update based on different filters or date ranges.

Here's the R code to get started:

```r
# Load in the packages
library(tidyverse)      # for data manipulate
library(tidytuesdayR)   # to access TidyTuesday data
library(quarto)         # to access Quarto functionality

# Load in TT data object based on date
birds <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(x = "2023-01-10")
```

Now that we have our packages and data loaded, we can start setting up the Quarto parameters. The `params` variable defines a list of parameters we want to use in our reports, such as the report title and the desired date range for filtering the data. We begin by storing these as objects themselves.

```r
# Parameterize your report
report_title <- "Birdfeeder Visitation Report"
date_range <- c("2023-01-01", "2023-06-30")
```

Now we bring everything together.

```r
# Create a Quarto document
quarto_document("birdfeeder_report.Rmd",
  title = report_title,
  params = list(date_range = date_range),
  output = "birdfeeder_report.html"
) %>%
  quarto_chunk() %>%
  quarto_code("library(ggplot2)") %>%
  quarto_chunk() %>%
  quarto_code("filtered_data <- subset(data, Date >= date_range[1] & Date <= date_range[2])") %>%
  quarto_chunk() %>%
  quarto_code("ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Date, y = Visits)) + geom_line()") %>%
  quarto_chunk() %>%
  quarto_code("ggsave('birdfeeder_plot.png')")
```

We create a Quarto document using the `quarto_document()` function, specifying the input R Markdown file, report title, parameter list, and desired output format (in this case, HTML).

We then use the `quarto_chunk()` and `quarto_code()` functions to add code chunks to our document. The code chunks contain R code for filtering the data based on the specified date range and creating a line plot using ggplot2. Finally, we save the generated plot as a PNG file using ggsave().

## In Conclusion

By leveraging Quarto and its capabilities for reproducible reporting, you can transform your reporting workflow from manual and error-prone to automated and efficient. Parameterizing reports allows you to easily update and regenerate them based on changing data or analysis requirements.

Reproducible documents not only save time but also enhance collaboration and ensure the accuracy and integrity of your reports. Give Quarto a try in the RStudio environment and experience the power of streamlining your reporting workflow.

Start producing reproducible documents today and say goodbye to the hassles of manual report updates!

Happy reporting with Quarto!
