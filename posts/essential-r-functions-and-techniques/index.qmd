## Introduction

While I am far from being an official programmer, I do code something almost every day. 

### Dates and Sequence of Dates

Creating a simple sequence of dates with a step of 1 day:

```r
seq(as.Date('1990-01-01'), as.Date('2010-12-31'), by = 'day')
```

Creating two vectors of dates between two dates, one of the first day and one of the last day of each month:

```r
start_dates <- seq(date_1, date_2, by = '1 month')
end_dates <- seq(date_1 + months(1), date_2 + months(1), by = "month") %>% rollbackward() 
```


Filling in gaps of dates using `padr`.

### Bounding Boxes

Bounding boxes for coordinates.
