## Overview of Challenge

The [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a community-driven event that encourages cartographers, map enthusiasts, and data visualization enthusiasts to create and share a different map each day for 30 consecutive days.

Participants engage in this challenge to showcase their creativity, explore diverse mapping techniques, and contribute to the growing field of map design. Each day of the challenge is associated with a specific theme or prompt, ranging from traditional cartography topics to more unconventional and imaginative ideas. The challenge not only fosters skill development but also builds a sense of community among mapmakers who share their unique perspectives and interpretations through the maps they create.
