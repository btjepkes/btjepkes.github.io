## Overview of Challenge

The [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a community event that encourages map enthusiasts of all levels to create and share a different map each day for 30 consecutive days. Each day of the challenge is associated with a specific theme or prompt, ranging from traditional cartography topics to more unconventional and imaginative ideas. The challenge not only fosters skill development but also builds a sense of community among mapmakers who share their unique perspectives through the maps they create.

## My 2023 Contributions

Here are my contributions to the challenge. Feel free to explore the details on each map product by clicking/tapping the map previews below. I was not able to create a map for every day, but this was my first time partaking in this challenge so I am happy with how many I created.

## Tools, Data, and Techniques

Here is some general information on the software, data sources, and cartographic techniques I used to create maps for this challenge. See the detailed overviews of each map for an in-depth acknowledgement of these attributes.

**Tools** -- ArcGIS Pro 3.2, R/RStudio using primarily the `ggplot`, `osmdata`, `rnaturalearth`, and `sf` packages.

**Data** -- OpenStreetMap, Esri Living Atlas, Natural Earth, and the IUCN.

**Techniques/Styles** -- Graduated symbols, choropleth, hexbin, bivariate, polygon overlay with blending, and contour creation from a digital elevation model (DEM).
