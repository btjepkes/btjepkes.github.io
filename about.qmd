- Adept at using R Markdown and Quarto for reproducible reporting.



## Education

### Formal Learning

My educational background is primarily in **wildlife conservation science** along with **geographic information systems**. My college coursework spread into several adjacent topics (e.g., soil science, watershed management, statistics, and forestry) which allows me to be multidisciplinary.

- **MA, Geography** | University of Missouri-Columbia | Ant. May 2025

- **BS, Wildlife Ecology** | University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point | May 2019

### Continued Learning

I pride myself on being someone who seeks out continuous learning. Be it at my work or during my free time, I love learning new techniques, workflows, and software.

- Esri MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), including Spatial Data Science and Cartography.

- LinkedIn Learning, including a variety of modules on data science, coding in R, and creating maps pragmatically.

## Work Experience

### Post-Degree

Since obtaining my degree, I have held a variety of roles within the conservation career space.

- **Assistant Wildlife Diversity Coordinator** | MO Department of Conservation | 08/22--Present

- **Assistant Natural History Biologist** | MO Department of Conservation | 10/19--08/22

- **Biological Science Technician** | Agassiz NWR, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | 05/19--10/19

### Pre-Degree

While in college, I gained high-quality research and management experience.

- **Ungulate Ecology Student Teaching Assistant** | UWSP | 01/19--05/19

- **Student Project Assistant** | Wisconsin Center for Wildlife | 12/17--05/19

## Professional Organizations

### The Wildlife Society

The Wildlife Society (TWS) has been my primary professional organization since my freshman year of college. I have held several leadership roles within TWS during this time.

### Society for Conservation GIS

The Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS) is a relatively new addition to my professional involvement.
