- I recently started my **Masters Degree** within the [Geography Department](https://geography.missouri.edu/) at the University of Missouri. I am in the process of developing my thesis project, so stay tuned for more. Please [reach out](contact.qmd) if you would like to collaborate on any geospatial projects.

- I am excited to have registered for the **Posit 2023 Conference** in September, where I will be attending virtually. Looking forward to learning more about open source data science. More info on posit::conf(2023) [here](https://posit.co/conference/).

- One of my latest maps, **Stamped in History: 50 Years of Imperiled Species Conservation**, recently won 2nd place in the 2023 GIS Certification Institute (GISCI) [Map Contest](https://www.gisci.org/News/Issues-News-Policy/gisci-announces-2023-map-contest-winners) within the Professional category.

- My passion for this field was ignited during my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree.

- Additionally, I completed several internships, independent projects, and technician experiences, which I pursued during summers and part-time throughout the academic year.

## Drawn to geospatial. {.intro-heading}

As I delved further into my wildlife career, I came to the realization that location served as a crucial factor linking the majority of ecological data. This insight sparked my interest in **spatial ecology and geospatial technologies**, which captivated me with their intriguing possibilities. I became deeply fascinated by the study of spatial relationships between organisms and their environment, and by the use of cutting-edge tools to map and analyze these relationships.

- Driven by my growing fascination with geospatial technologies, I sought out opportunities to learn and apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in my conservation work.

- I enrolled in specialized courses and workshops to acquire proficiency in GIS software and its application in conservation planning, landscape ecology, and wildlife management.
