    "text": "Drawn to geospatial.\nAs I delved further into my wildlife career, I came to the realization that location served as a crucial factor linking the majority of ecological data. This insight sparked my interest in spatial ecology and geospatial technologies, which captivated me with their intriguing possibilities. I became deeply fascinated by the study of spatial relationships between organisms and their environment, and by the use of cutting-edge tools to map and analyze these relationships.\nDriven by my growing fascination with geospatial technologies, I sought out opportunities to learn and apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in my conservation work. I enrolled in specialized courses and workshops to acquire proficiency in GIS software and its application in conservation planning, landscape ecology, and wildlife management. Through hands-on experience and project work, I developed a strong foundation in geospatial analysis and data management, and became adept at leveraging GIS tools to gain critical insights into complex ecological issues."

This exciting opportunity presents me with the chance to delve into the underlying spatial theory that informs the cutting-edge techniques that I have employed in my ecological studies.\nThrough my Master’s program, I will have the opportunity to study a range of topics that span physical, human, and environmental geography, including spatial analysis, remote sensing, and cartography. I am particularly excited to delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of these topics, to analyze complex spatial relationships, and to explore the implications of geographic research for society and the environment. Ultimately, my goal is to synthesize my practical experience in wildlife ecology and management with the theoretical concepts I will gain in my Master’s program to continue to advance conservation efforts and contribute to the broader field of geography."

They are an important species for the ecosystems they inhabit by playing a key role in controlling insect populations and serving as a food source for predators (e.g., eagles, coyotes).\n\n\n\nGreater sage grouse at lek. Photo: Pat Hnilicka/USFWS\n\n\nSage grouse populations have declined in recent years due to habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to conservation efforts and protections being put in place to help preserve the species. Mapping where these birds have been located in recent years can show us just how much their distribution has been restricted when compared to their historic range.\n\n\nData Sources\nToday, we will pull records of sage grouse occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. GBIF is a database of species occurrence records from sources all over the globe. rgbifis an r package that allows us to interface with the GBIF API. It includes functions for searching for taxonomic names, retrieving information on data providers, getting species occurrence records, getting counts of occurrence records, and using the GBIF tile map service to make rasters summarizing huge amounts of data."

Navigate to the “Data” section and select “Intact Forest Landscapes.” Download the IFL dataset in the desired format (e.g., shapefile, geopackage).\n\n\n2.
