These milestones serve as reminders of my resilience and commitment, fueling my determination to face new challenges with the same vigor in the coming years.\n\nRecongnitions\n\nIn early 2023, I humbly accepted the Missouri Department of Conservation Science Branch Term Employee of the Year award. Although this organization is filled with many hardworking individuals, it felt good receiving recognition for all my years of service and effort towards quality science.\nAnother recognition this year was my acceptance into the National Honor Society for Geospatial Technology (Gamma Sigma Theta2) through the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence. This membership is a step towards my new professional emphasis area of GIS.\nRelated to the use of geospatial technologies, one of my recent maps won 2nd place in the GIS Certification Institute 2023 Map Contest within the professional category3.\n\n\n\nProjects & Presentations\n\nOne of my main work projects for this year was reporting on the implementation of the Missouri Bat Habitat Conservation Plan. Completing the first-of-its-kind annual report4 for this project was a daunting task and allowed me to creatively explore many facets of technical reporting, spatial analysis, and data management.\nOn a more personal note, a big endeavor for me in 2023 was learning Quarto and building out my personal portfolio. I have enjoyed learning about web development and version control through this process.\nAnother creative project in 2023 was participating in the #30DayMapChallenge on social media. Through this challenge, I was able to create several cartographic visuals5 across my favorite topics like trees, endangered species conservation, and multiple wildlife species. Looking forward to future years of participation."

While learning tends to come at a cost, either monetarily or otherwise, I managed to find several worthwhile learning opportunities this year.\n\nConferences\n\nIn the first half of 2023 I was able to attend two in-person conferences here in Missouri. The first was the MDC Science Branch Conference, where I was able to present my poster on the Missouri Bat HCP. Next, I attended the Missouri GIS Conference and gave a talk over how I integrated reproducible reporting workflows in R with geospatial modeling in ArcGIS Pro for bat monitoring work.\nIn September, I was able to virtually attend the 2023 Posit Conference where I learned a ton from all the interesting talks and presentations. I especially loved the inspirational talks on using Quarto for reporting, academic writing, and beyond.\n\n\n\nWebinars, Trainings, and Courses\n\nMuch of my free time in 2023 was spent taking various trainings and and attending webinars across a broad scope of topics. This included a fantastic Introductory Bayesian Workshop, many LinkedIn Learning modules, lots of YouTube, and plenty of other ones from Esri6, ESA, NASA, and TWS.\nThis past fall was chock full of learning opportunities as I took several university courses. These included three largely unrelated but equally integrated classes on data science, biogeography, and geographic theory."

    "section": "Providing Solutions to Study Wildlife",
    "text": "Providing Solutions to Study Wildlife\nGeographic information systems (GIS) have revolutionized wildlife research by providing tools to manage, analyze, and visualize spatial data. Here are four ways wildlife researchers use GIS to study wildlife and their habitats:\n\n#1 - Surveying wildlife\nOne of the main aims of biologists that need to manage wildlife populations is getting an estimate of density (i.e., animals per unit area), sex ratio (i.e., number of females vs. number of males), and age structure (i.e., the distribution of age classes within a population).\n\nPopulation metrics like these and many others are often the result of data collected during field surveys, where biologists count the number of individuals they see or hear along a specified survey route (in most cases). GIS technologies, like those discussed in the below video, are used by biologists to navigate and collect data during surveys.\n\n\n#2 - Habitat analysis\nGIS can be used to map and analyze wildlife habitat by collecting data on environmental variables that have been supported by studies to impact the use of that area by wildlife. These metrics could include habitat elements like vegetation type, topographic features, water availability, and other factors that influence habitat quality. This information helps researchers understand the spatial distribution of wildlife species and identify areas that may be important for conservation.\nThe mapping capabilities of GIS allow researchers to understand the impact of humans on wildlife, especially when it comes to the fragmentation and reduction of habitat. By mapping and analyzing the size, shape, and connectivity of different habitat patches, they can identify areas where habitat fragmentation is a problem and develop strategies to address it.\n\n\n#3 - Movement patterns\nWhen it is safe and ethical to do so, biologists can track the movements of wildlife through GPS collars or other tracking devices. By mapping these movement patterns, researchers can understand their behavior and use that knowledge to better manage populations and habitats.\n\n\n\nA researcher with the USFWS uses VHF radio telemetry equipment to triangulate the location of a mountain lion. Photo: USFWS via CC.\n\n\nBiologists use GIS to create models of animal movement, which can help them understand how animals use different habitats and how they move across the landscape. These models combine data on animal behavior, habitat characteristics, and environmental variables. This can be used to identify areas where animals are most likely to be found, as well as areas where targeted conservation efforts would be fruitful.\n\n\n#4 - Disease mapping\nWildlife disease ecologists use GIS to track the spread of diseases within and among wildlife populations. Spatial analysis tools are used within a GIS to identify disease hotspots, clustering, and spatial trends. By mapping disease outbreaks and analyzing the spatial patterns of infections, researchers can identify areas that may be at high risk and develop targeted interventions to prevent the spread of disease.\nGIS can also be used to model the spread of diseases in wildlife populations. By simulating the movement of animals across the landscape and the transmission of the disease, researchers can predict the likelihood and spread of disease outbreaks. This allows wildlife managers to control the spread of certain diseases by targeting certain high-risk areas."

    "text": "Since switching to Quarto, I have also started using Reveal.js for most of my presentations. However, there are certain situations where I need to use PowerPoint due to venue restrictions. I also have a bunch of past conference and project presentations that I would like to display interactively on my site. How can I do this? Well, I have devised a workflow that I am not sure is the best way, but it works for me until someone tells me otherwise. It is important to note that while this converts my PPT files, any transitions or animations are lost because of my initial step of saving to a PDF.\n\n\nLet’s take a run through my workflow. We must first export the PowerPoint as a .pdf within the PowerPoint software. Then, we can split each slide into its own .png or .jpg image using the pdftools::pdf_convert function. From here it is a simple for loop and asis output specification in a Quarto document setup to create a revealjs presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[PPTX] --&gt; |Convert| B(PDF)\n  B --&gt; |pdf_convert| C(JPGs)\n  C --&gt;  D{QMD revealjs}\n  D --&gt; |Render| F[HTML]\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will result in a HTML file with your slides where each image is displayed per slide while giving you most of the functionality of reveal.js.\n\n\n\n\nNow we can run through an example with the code included.

This code will create a list of images from your working directory, then iterate over them to set each one as the background image of its own slide in your revealjs presentation.

    "title": "Create Annotated Bibliographies with Quarto",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An annotated bibliography is a compilation of sources related to a particular research topic, each accompanied by a brief evaluative commentary. Unlike a traditional bibliography that solely lists references, an annotated bibliography provides a concise summary of each source’s content, methodology, and relevance to the research project. It serves as a critical tool for graduate students and other researchers to assess the scholarly landscape, demonstrating their understanding of key literature and showcasing the ability to critically analyze and synthesize information.\nThis annotated compilation not only aids in constructing a robust theoretical framework but also helps researchers (1) identify gaps in existing literature and (2) determine the potential contributions of their own work within the academic discourse. For the purposes of this post, we will be creating a bibliography that has the full citation text followed by summary bullet points underneath which can be organized into sections or themes.\n\n\nZotero is a free, open-source reference management software designed to help researchers collect, organize, cite, and share bibliographic information. Quarto is a free, open-source scientific and technical publishing system produced by Posit. These two programs can be combined to create books, scientific articles, websites, presentations, and many other products.\nI suggest using these options because they are free, natively integrated, and highly flexible. This process allows for great flexibility, like rendering into HTML, PDF, or Word formats independently or all at once. I prefer multi-format rendering so I can send them all out in a zipped folder and the recipient can choose whichever works best for them.\nPerhaps the most important element of this workflow, at least in my opinion, is that all your summary notes are maintained in Zotero. This allows you to keep any citation notes organized in the reference management software and not spread out across versions of bibliographic documentation.\n\n\n\nZotero provides a reporting functionality in the desktop application by right-clicking an item, selection of items, or an entire collection, then selecting “Generate Report From…”. This option works well if you need to quickly output your citations and notes, but is limited to exporting in HTML or Rich Text formats.\nAnother alternative workflow might be to use Obsidian, a freemium note-taking software that operates on Markdown files. This application integrates very well will Zotero as well, but my personal preference is Quarto in the RStudio environment. Consider following this tutorial if you want to use Obsidian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step, which you may be at already, is to get literature into your Zotero library. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this, but I prefer using either the Add Item by Identifier tool or the web extension to automatically load documents into their respective libraries, collections, or sub-collections.\nOnce you have your literature in Zotero you can review each article as you normally would. While doing so, add in notes and annotations that summarize the main findings, key terms, important methods, and so forth. An important note about this workflow is that each comment or annotation made on an article must be stored as an individual note item. Each of these will eventually become a bullet point in our final bibliography. Your Zotero should look similar to the below screenshot.\n\n\n\nExample of a Zotero library item to include in our bibliography with each comment as an individual note item.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have all your literature added to Zotero and any annotations you need to make based on your review of each article, it is now time to export this information. Just like with the reports, exporting can occur at the level of each item, selection of items, or entire collections. I have found it easiest to make sub-collections for major themes or sections.\nIn this step, we are simply exporting the information from Zotero into a portable BibTeX file with the .bib extension. Other similar extension types may work, but I have only tested the standard format. To export, you need to (1) right-click the item of interest, (2) select “Export…”, (3) ensure that the Format: BibTeX and the Export Notes options are selected, and (4) specify an accessible location to store this file. This should save a .bib file to this location containing all pertinent information and notes on the citation(s) of interest.\nIf you open up the .bib file you just exported, each included article should look similar to the following example. The annote portions contain the notes we added in the previous step.\n@article{morisette_tracking_2009,\n    title = {Tracking the rhythm of the seasons in the face of global change: phenological research in the 21st century},\n    volume = {7},\n    issn = {1540-9295, 1540-9309},\n    shorttitle = {Tracking the rhythm of the seasons in the face of global change},\n    url = {https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/070217},\n    doi = {10.1890/070217},\n    abstract = {Phenology is the study of recurring life‐cycle events, classic examples being the flowering of plants and animal migration. Phenological responses are increasingly relevant for addressing applied environmental issues. Yet, challenges remain with respect to spanning scales of observation, integrating observations across taxa, and modeling phenological sequences to enable ecological forecasts in light of future climate change. Recent advances that are helping to address these questions include refined landscape‐scale phenology estimates from satellite data, advanced, instrument‐based approaches for field measurements, and new cyberinfrastructure for archiving and distribution of products. These breakthroughs are improving our understanding in diverse areas, including modeling land‐surface exchange, evaluating climate–phenology relationships, and making land‐management decisions.},\n    language = {en},\n    number = {5},\n    urldate = {2023-12-31},\n    journal = {Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment},\n    author = {Morisette, Jeffrey T and Richardson, Andrew D and Knapp, Alan K and Fisher, Jeremy I and Graham, Eric A and Abatzoglou, John and Wilson, Bruce E and Breshears, David D and Henebry, Geoffrey M and Hanes, Jonathan M and Liang, Liang},\n    month = jun,\n    year = {2009},\n    pages = {253--260},\n    annote = {Given the increasing rate of climate change projected over the next 80 years, there is a pressing need to establish the spatial and temporal phenological responses to climate change.\n},\n    annote = {“help us to adapt to climate change and to better manage our natural resources.” (Morisette et al., 2009, p. 259) “Cyberinfrastructure will enable these data to be synthesized and used by increasingly advanced spatial–temporal analysis and modeling activities” (Morisette et al., 2009, p. 259)\n},\n    annote = {Predicting and assessing phenological responses can be difficult due to issues associated with spatial scale and physiological response differences across taxa.\n}\nImportant Note - If you update any metadata about the citation (e.g., authors, abstract, etc.) or add/edit item notes you will need to re-export a .bib file to see these updates carried throughout this workflow. That is unless you use the Better BibTeX for Zotero Extension, which can automatically re-export the collection to a .bib file.\n\n\n\n\nThese next steps will all be carried out using Quarto within RStudio. At the time of this post, I am using this workflow with R version 4.3.2, Quarto version 1.4.510, and RStudio version 2023.09.1 without issues. Some of these steps may need to be adapted based on your working versions and system configuration. This post assumes you have successfully installed Quarto on your machine and are comfortable with markdown document creation using this program.\n\n\nWhen starting a new Quarto document, often one of the first steps is setting up your YAML header. This initial bit of code is bordered by --- on the top and bottom, and contains the necessary elements that tells Quarto how to generate the document.\n---\n1title: \"Literature Review\"\ntitle-block-banner: true\n2format:\n  html: default\n  docx: default\n  pdf: default\n3bibliography: exported_items.bib\n4link-citations: false\n5csl: apa-cv.csl\n6execute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  output: asis\n---\n\n1\n\nSet the title and title banner formatting for the document.\n\n2\n\nSpecify which output formats to render, including any options (defaults used in this example).\n\n3\n\nSpecify the BibTeX file to reference. This will be the one we just exported from Zotero with our notes.\n\n4\n\nTell Quarto whether to link each in-text citation to the full bibliography at the bottom.\n\n5\n\nImportant step! - Specify what CSL (Citation Style Language) to use for the bibliography. This example uses the APA-CV style because it formats the full citation text for both the in-text and references section. This style and many others can be downloaded from the Zotero Style Repository.\n\n6\n\nSet the document-wide execution options for the code chunks. Here we suppress both the code and warning messages. Specifying output: asis allows for the bullet points to be rendered as raw markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are only two packages needed to perform the required steps. The first is the bib2df package, which is a BibTeX parser that turns .bib files into easy-to-read tibbles. The second is the dplyr package within the tidyverse, which allows us to wrangle, filter, and select data from our parsed dataframe. Install these packages as necessary from CRAN, then load them into your environment.\n# Load these required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # --- for data wrangling\nlibrary(bib2df)    # --- for .bib parsing\n\n\n\nQuarto is very similar to many other markdown formats, including RMarkdown, such that you can add in-text citations based on their citation keys. Zotero will generate these automatically when exporting the .bib file, but can sometimes lead to issues if they change with successive exports. To resolve this, a good option is to use the Better BibTeX for Zotero Extension which makes it easier to manage your citation keys.\nThe following code provides an example of how to insert a citation into your Quarto document. Traditionally, this is how an in-text citation would be placed at that location, but since we specified our CSL as the APA-CV style it will render the entire citation instead. The morisette_tracking_2009 portion is the citation key and will be referenced in the next part as well.\n@morisette_tracking_2009\nAfter you insert the proper citation, the next part is a chunk of executable R code. This is the meat and potatoes of the whole operation.\n\nOption 1Option 2\n\n\nThis chunk will need to be copy-pasted after each citation key you want to use. Then you will need to copy the citation key and paste it into whichever chunk follows it.\n1df &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file = rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography) |&gt;\n2  filter(BIBTEXKEY == \"morisette_tracking_2009\") |&gt;\n3  select(contains(\"ANNOTE\")) |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"Column\", value = \"Value\") |&gt;\n  pull(Value)\n\n4list &lt;- paste(\"- \", df, collapse = \"\\n\")\ncat(list)\n\n1\n\nUsing the bib2df function, parse the .bib file specified in the YAML into a dataframe. The rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography does not need to be changed between citation code chunks.\n\n2\n\nFilter this new dataframe for the citation of interest as specified by its citation key. This is the only portion of the code chunk that will need to be changed between citations to update the citation key text in the parentheses.\n\n3\n\nSelect only the fields for our annotations, which are parsed as “ANNOTE”. Then collect a vector of these character strings.\n\n4\n\nTo create the bullet list, this part adds a “-” before and a linebreak after each note. Then we concatenate and print our notes, which output as an un-ordered list as raw markdown to be rendered.\n\n\n\n\nThis chunk is strictly optional, but makes the process a little less cluttered. Here, we create a function to pull the notes associated with that specific key. Place this chunk at the beginning of the document, then you can just call the pull_notes function instead of repeating the whole chunk each time.\npull_notes &lt;- function(key) {\n  df &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file = rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography) |&gt; \n    filter(BIBTEXKEY == key) |&gt;              \n    select(contains(\"ANNOTE\")) |&gt;                                  \n    gather(key = \"Column\", value = \"Value\") |&gt;                     \n    pull(Value)                                                    \n  \n  list &lt;- paste(\"- \", df, collapse = \"\\n\")                         \n  cat(list)                                                        \n}\nSo after each citation key, you can just paste the following to run the function:\npull_notes(key = \"morisette_tracking_2009\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone using the Better BibTeX extension, the structure of the exported .bib file varies slightly from the one exemplified above. If you exported an item or collection from Zotero with the Format: Better BibTeX option set the annotations will not be individually separated. Instead, they will appear in the same field. But no worries, we have an alternative solutions for this.\n\nBibTeX ExampleCode Example\n\n\nHere is an example .bib file when exporting using the BetterBibTeX format. See how all of our annotations are combined into a single “note” field and that they are separated by a \\par? That is the main difference than the previous .bib file we looked at.\n@article{MorisetteRichardsonKnapp:2009,\n  title = {Tracking the Rhythm of the Seasons in the Face of Global Change: Phenological Research in the 21st Century},\n  shorttitle = {Tracking the Rhythm of the Seasons in the Face of Global Change},\n  author = {Morisette, Jeffrey T and Richardson, Andrew D and Knapp, Alan K and Fisher, Jeremy I and Graham, Eric A and Abatzoglou, John and Wilson, Bruce E and Breshears, David D and Henebry, Geoffrey M and Hanes, Jonathan M and Liang, Liang},\n  year = {2009},\n  month = jun,\n  journal = {Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {253--260},\n  issn = {1540-9295, 1540-9309},\n  doi = {10.1890/070217},\n  urldate = {2023-12-31},\n  abstract = {Phenology is the study of recurring life-cycle events, classic examples being the flowering of plants and animal migration.

As I mentioned earlier, there are several formats we can use (e.g., .pdf, .docx). I tend to render into HTML initially, then troubleshoot Pandoc conversion issues with other formats once I know it compiles.\nIf everything goes as planned, you should end up with a document looking similar to the below examples. Styles will depend on your configuration and can be adjusted to fit your needs. For this example, I have placed a single citation and its summary notes under a heading titled “Ecological Phenology”, which could be a broad theme or a way to structure your thesis sections. A comprehensive bibliography will be printed at the end of the document showing all citations from the citation keys referenced throughout.\n\nHTMLPDFDOCXSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Literature Review for Masters Thesis\"\ntitle-block-banner: true           \nformat:                            \n  html: default                    \n  docx: default                    \n  pdf: default                     \nbibliography: exported_items.bib   \nlink-citations: false              \ncsl: apa-cv.csl                    \nexecute:                           \n  echo: false                      \n  warning: false                   \n  output: asis                     \n---\n\n## Ecological Phenology\n\n@morisette_tracking_2009\n\n```r\ndf &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file = rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography) |&gt;\n  filter(BIBTEXKEY == \"morisette_tracking_2009\") |&gt;\n  select(contains(\"ANNOTE\")) |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"Column\", value = \"Value\") |&gt;\n  pull(Value)\n\nlist &lt;- paste(\"- \", df, collapse = \"\\n\")\ncat(list)\n```\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can see that each of the notes we exported from Zotero are now their own bullet point under their respective citation. One potential alteration to this would be to concatenate all the notes into a single paragraph or to make the un-ordered list into an ordered one. The annotations in the .bib file are parsed in the order they appear in Zotero which is alphabetical by default. Feel free to mess around will the different formats and styles to create a final product that meets your needs.\n\n\n\n\nThis process has worked exceptionally well for me so far in my academic journey. I am a huge proponent of open-source programs, like Quarto, that help make research and technical publishing more streamlined.\nIf you are interested in other cool ways to handle citations and bibliographies in Quarto, I highly suggest checking out the website of Andrew Heiss. If others have suggestions on improving this workflow or techniques of handling this sort of literature review another way, I would love to hear more about it. Happy citing!"

I prefer multi-format rendering so I can send them all out in a zipped folder and the recipient can choose whichever works best for them.\nPerhaps the most important element of this workflow, at least in my opinion, is that all your summary notes are maintained in Zotero. This allows you to keep any citation notes organized in the reference management software and not spread out across versions of bibliographic documentation.\n\n\n\nZotero provides a reporting functionality in the desktop application by right-clicking an item, selection of items, or an entire collection, then selecting “Generate Report From…”. This option works well if you need to quickly output your citations and notes, but is limited to exporting in HTML or Rich Text formats.\nAnother alternative workflow might be to use Obsidian, a freemium note-taking software that operates on Markdown files. This application integrates very well will Zotero as well, but my personal preference is Quarto in the RStudio environment. Consider following this tutorial if you want to use Obsidian."

    "text": "The first step, which you may be at already, is to get literature into your Zotero library. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this, but I prefer using either the Add Item by Identifier tool or the web extension to automatically load documents into their respective libraries, collections, or sub-collections.\nOnce you have your literature in Zotero you can review each article as you normally would. While doing so, add in notes and annotations that summarize the main findings, key terms, important methods, and so forth. An important note about this workflow is that each comment or annotation made on an article must be stored as an individual note item. Each of these will eventually become a bullet point in our final bibliography. Your Zotero should look similar to the below screenshot.\n\n\n\nExample of a Zotero library item to include in our bibliography with each comment as an individual note item.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have all your literature added to Zotero and any annotations you need to make based on your review of each article, it is now time to export this information. Just like with the reports, exporting can occur at the level of each item, selection of items, or entire collections. I have found it easiest to make sub-collections for major themes or sections.\nIn this step, we are simply exporting the information from Zotero into a portable BibTeX file with the .bib extension. Other similar extension types may work, but I have only tested the standard format. To export, you need to (1) right-click the item of interest, (2) select “Export…”, (3) ensure that the Format: BibTeX and the Export Notes options are selected, and (4) specify an accessible location to store this file. This should save a .bib file to this location containing all pertinent information and notes on the citation(s) of interest.\nIf you open up the .bib file you just exported, each included article should look similar to the following example. The annote portions contain the notes we added in the previous step.\n@article{morisette_tracking_2009,\n    title = {Tracking the rhythm of the seasons in the face of global change: phenological research in the 21st century},\n    volume = {7},\n    issn = {1540-9295, 1540-9309},\n    shorttitle = {Tracking the rhythm of the seasons in the face of global change},\n    url = {https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/070217},\n    doi = {10.1890/070217},\n    abstract = {Phenology is the study of recurring life‐cycle events, classic examples being the flowering of plants and animal migration. Phenological responses are increasingly relevant for addressing applied environmental issues. Yet, challenges remain with respect to spanning scales of observation, integrating observations across taxa, and modeling phenological sequences to enable ecological forecasts in light of future climate change. Recent advances that are helping to address these questions include refined landscape‐scale phenology estimates from satellite data, advanced, instrument‐based approaches for field measurements, and new cyberinfrastructure for archiving and distribution of products. These breakthroughs are improving our understanding in diverse areas, including modeling land‐surface exchange, evaluating climate–phenology relationships, and making land‐management decisions.},\n    language = {en},\n    number = {5},\n    urldate = {2023-12-31},\n    journal = {Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment},\n    author = {Morisette, Jeffrey T and Richardson, Andrew D and Knapp, Alan K and Fisher, Jeremy I and Graham, Eric A and Abatzoglou, John and Wilson, Bruce E and Breshears, David D and Henebry, Geoffrey M and Hanes, Jonathan M and Liang, Liang},\n    month = jun,\n    year = {2009},\n    pages = {253--260},\n    annote = {Given the increasing rate of climate change projected over the next 80 years, there is a pressing need to establish the spatial and temporal phenological responses to climate change.\n},\n    annote = {“help us to adapt to climate change and to better manage our natural resources.” (Morisette et al., 2009, p. 259) “Cyberinfrastructure will enable these data to be synthesized and used by increasingly advanced spatial–temporal analysis and modeling activities” (Morisette et al., 2009, p. 259)\n},\n    annote = {Predicting and assessing phenological responses can be difficult due to issues associated with spatial scale and physiological response differences across taxa.\n}\nImportant Note - If you update any metadata about the citation (e.g., authors, abstract, etc.) or add/edit item notes you will need to re-export a .bib file to see these updates carried throughout this workflow. That is unless you use the Better BibTeX for Zotero Extension, which can automatically re-export the collection to a .bib file."

    "text": "These next steps will all be carried out using Quarto within RStudio. At the time of this post, I am using this workflow with R version 4.3.2, Quarto version 1.4.510, and RStudio version 2023.09.1 without issues. Some of these steps may need to be adapted based on your working versions and system configuration. This post assumes you have successfully installed Quarto on your machine and are comfortable with markdown document creation using this program.\n\n\nWhen starting a new Quarto document, often one of the first steps is setting up your YAML header. This initial bit of code is bordered by --- on the top and bottom, and contains the necessary elements that tells Quarto how to generate the document.\n---\n1title: \"Literature Review\"\ntitle-block-banner: true\n2format:\n  html: default\n  docx: default\n  pdf: default\n3bibliography: exported_items.bib\n4link-citations: false\n5csl: apa-cv.csl\n6execute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  output: asis\n---\n\n1\n\nSet the title and title banner formatting for the document.\n\n2\n\nSpecify which output formats to render, including any options (defaults used in this example).\n\n3\n\nSpecify the BibTeX file to reference. This will be the one we just exported from Zotero with our notes.\n\n4\n\nTell Quarto whether to link each in-text citation to the full bibliography at the bottom.\n\n5\n\nImportant step! - Specify what CSL (Citation Style Language) to use for the bibliography. This example uses the APA-CV style because it formats the full citation text for both the in-text and references section. This style and many others can be downloaded from the Zotero Style Repository.\n\n6\n\nSet the document-wide execution options for the code chunks. Here we suppress both the code and warning messages. Specifying output: asis allows for the bullet points to be rendered as raw markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are only two packages needed to perform the required steps. The first is the bib2df package, which is a BibTeX parser that turns .bib files into easy-to-read tibbles. The second is the dplyr package within the tidyverse, which allows us to wrangle, filter, and select data from our parsed dataframe. Install these packages as necessary from CRAN, then load them into your environment.\n# Load these required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # --- for data wrangling\nlibrary(bib2df)    # --- for .bib parsing\n\n\n\nQuarto is very similar to many other markdown formats, including RMarkdown, such that you can add in-text citations based on their citation keys. Zotero will generate these automatically when exporting the .bib file, but can sometimes lead to issues if they change with successive exports. To resolve this, a good option is to use the Better BibTeX for Zotero Extension which makes it easier to manage your citation keys.\nThe following code provides an example of how to insert a citation into your Quarto document. Traditionally, this is how an in-text citation would be placed at that location, but since we specified our CSL as the APA-CV style it will render the entire citation instead. The morisette_tracking_2009 portion is the citation key and will be referenced in the next part as well.\n@morisette_tracking_2009\nAfter you insert the proper citation, the next part is a chunk of executable R code. This is the meat and potatoes of the whole operation.\n\nOption 1Option 2\n\n\nThis chunk will need to be copy-pasted after each citation key you want to use. Then you will need to copy the citation key and paste it into whichever chunk follows it.\n1df &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file = rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography) |&gt;\n2  filter(BIBTEXKEY == \"morisette_tracking_2009\") |&gt;\n3  select(contains(\"ANNOTE\")) |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"Column\", value = \"Value\") |&gt;\n  pull(Value)\n\n4list &lt;- paste(\"- \", df, collapse = \"\\n\")\ncat(list)\n\n1\n\nUsing the bib2df function, parse the .bib file specified in the YAML into a dataframe. The rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography does not need to be changed between citation code chunks.\n\n2\n\nFilter this new dataframe for the citation of interest as specified by its citation key. This is the only portion of the code chunk that will need to be changed between citations to update the citation key text in the parentheses.\n\n3\n\nSelect only the fields for our annotations, which are parsed as “ANNOTE”. Then collect a vector of these character strings.\n\n4\n\nTo create the bullet list, this part adds a “-” before and a linebreak after each note. Then we concatenate and print our notes, which output as an un-ordered list as raw markdown to be rendered.\n\n\n\n\nThis chunk is strictly optional, but makes the process a little less cluttered. Here, we create a function to pull the notes associated with that specific key. Place this chunk at the beginning of the document, then you can just call the pull_notes function instead of repeating the whole chunk each time.\npull_notes &lt;- function(key) {\n  df &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file = rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography) |&gt; \n    filter(BIBTEXKEY == key) |&gt;              \n    select(contains(\"ANNOTE\")) |&gt;                                  \n    gather(key = \"Column\", value = \"Value\") |&gt;                     \n    pull(Value)                                                    \n  \n  list &lt;- paste(\"- \", df, collapse = \"\\n\")                         \n  cat(list)                                                        \n}\nSo after each citation key, you can just paste the following to run the function:\npull_notes(key = \"morisette_tracking_2009\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone using the Better BibTeX extension, the structure of the exported .bib file varies slightly from the one exemplified above. If you exported an item or collection from Zotero with the Format: Better BibTeX option set the annotations will not be individually separated. Instead, they will appear in the same field. But no worries, we have an alternative solutions for this.\n\nBibTeX ExampleCode Example\n\n\nHere is an example .bib file when exporting using the BetterBibTeX format. See how all of our annotations are combined into a single “note” field and that they are separated by a \\par? That is the main difference than the previous .bib file we looked at.\n@article{MorisetteRichardsonKnapp:2009,\n  title = {Tracking the Rhythm of the Seasons in the Face of Global Change: Phenological Research in the 21st Century},\n  shorttitle = {Tracking the Rhythm of the Seasons in the Face of Global Change},\n  author = {Morisette, Jeffrey T and Richardson, Andrew D and Knapp, Alan K and Fisher, Jeremy I and Graham, Eric A and Abatzoglou, John and Wilson, Bruce E and Breshears, David D and Henebry, Geoffrey M and Hanes, Jonathan M and Liang, Liang},\n  year = {2009},\n  month = jun,\n  journal = {Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {253--260},\n  issn = {1540-9295, 1540-9309},\n  doi = {10.1890/070217},\n  urldate = {2023-12-31},\n  abstract = {Phenology is the study of recurring life-cycle events, classic examples being the flowering of plants and animal migration.

As I mentioned earlier, there are several formats we can use (e.g., .pdf, .docx). I tend to render into HTML initially, then troubleshoot Pandoc conversion issues with other formats once I know it compiles.\nIf everything goes as planned, you should end up with a document looking similar to the below examples. Styles will depend on your configuration and can be adjusted to fit your needs. For this example, I have placed a single citation and its summary notes under a heading titled “Ecological Phenology”, which could be a broad theme or a way to structure your thesis sections. A comprehensive bibliography will be printed at the end of the document showing all citations from the citation keys referenced throughout.\n\nHTMLPDFDOCXSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Literature Review for Masters Thesis\"\ntitle-block-banner: true           \nformat:                            \n  html: default                    \n  docx: default                    \n  pdf: default                     \nbibliography: exported_items.bib   \nlink-citations: false              \ncsl: apa-cv.csl                    \nexecute:                           \n  echo: false                      \n  warning: false                   \n  output: asis                     \n---\n\n## Ecological Phenology\n\n@morisette_tracking_2009\n\n```r\ndf &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file = rmarkdown::metadata$bibliography) |&gt;\n  filter(BIBTEXKEY == \"morisette_tracking_2009\") |&gt;\n  select(contains(\"ANNOTE\")) |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"Column\", value = \"Value\") |&gt;\n  pull(Value)\n\nlist &lt;- paste(\"- \", df, collapse = \"\\n\")\ncat(list)\n```\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can see that each of the notes we exported from Zotero are now their own bullet point under their respective citation. One potential alteration to this would be to concatenate all the notes into a single paragraph or to make the un-ordered list into an ordered one. The annotations in the .bib file are parsed in the order they appear in Zotero which is alphabetical by default. Feel free to mess around will the different formats and styles to create a final product that meets your needs."

    "text": "Hello! My name is Benjamin (Ben) Tjepkes and I am a wildlife ecologist and geographer with a passion for conservation data science. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Missouri studying geographic information systems (GIS) in the Department of Geography. My work focuses on using a variety of data science and geospatial tools to conduct research in ecology and biogeography. My professional interests revolve around the conservation of nature, especially under the pressures of climate change. I am especially interested in how climate drives species interactions, movement, and resource availability across the landscape.\n\n\n\nMe with one of our research black bears during a den check.\n\n\nMy professional career is based in wildlife ecology and management, which has been my home discipline for over seven years. Throughout my career, I have undertaken numerous research and management projects that centered on the study and conservation of wildlife and their habitats. My passion for this field was ignited during my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree. Additionally, I completed several internships, independent projects, and technician experiences during summers and part-time throughout the academic year. After earning my degree, I pursued several wildlife research and management positions that opened my eyes to my true passion of conservation work.\nAs I delved further into my wildlife career, I came to the realization that location served as a crucial factor linking the majority of ecological data. This insight sparked my interest in spatial ecology and geospatial technologies, which captivated me with their intriguing possibilities. I became deeply fascinated by the study of spatial relationships between organisms and their environment, and by the use of cutting-edge tools to map and analyze these relationships. Driven by my growing fascination with geospatial technologies, I sought out opportunities to learn and apply Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in my conservation work. I enrolled in specialized courses and workshops to acquire proficiency in GIS software and its application in conservation planning, landscape ecology, and wildlife management.\n\n\n\nSometimes a wildlife biologist needs to handle the wildlife, all with the proper permits, training, and equipment of course.\n\n\nWith a fervent desire to deepen my knowledge of the fundamental principles of geography, I am thrilled to announce my pursuit of a Master’s degree in Geography at the University of Missouri. This exciting opportunity presents me with the chance to delve into the underlying spatial theory that informs the cutting-edge techniques that I have employed in my ecological studies. Through my Master’s program, I have the opportunity to study a broad range of topics spanning physical, human, and environmental geography. My goal is to synthesize my practical experience in wildlife ecology with the theoretical concepts gained in my Master’s program.\n\n\n\n\nMe with one of our research black bears during a den check.\nSometimes a wildlife biologist needs to handle the wildlife, all with the proper permits, training, and equipment of course."

    "text": "Shoreline erosion is a common problem faced by thousands of waterfront property owners. Many of whom view erosion issues as an inevitable consequence of living near the water. However, it is important to recognize that human actions can significantly contribute to and exacerbate erosion, and that there are steps we can take to prevent or reduce it. Our shorelines serve as the conversion zone between land and water. This is an extremely tough and very important job. With the many forces acting on them, our shores need to be maintained for the health of our natural systems and the security of our infrastructure.\n\nThe problem is that these forces are relentless. Wave action in the summer and ice push in the winter both nick away soil along the water’s edge. Run-off from streets and the upheaving frost action degrade shorelines from the land side. All while the wind erodes the ground from both sides. In general, lakes are considered depositional features, and rivers as erosional features. There are some differences between these classifications but both mean that a great deal of energy is acting on your shoreline every moment. Erosional forces already push coasts to their structural limit. Then we as humans come along and intensify those forces to the detriment of both parties."

    "text": "Impactful Human Activities\nUnfortunately, many of the activities we partake in as humans make conditions worse for our water features. We do not set out to intentionally harm these systems, rather the impacts are a by-product of other pursuits.\n\nReducing the Amount of Shoreline Vegetation\nFor one reason or another, many waterfront property owners like to clear the vegetation along their shoreline. Terrestrial plants (those on land) get torn out to create a clear view of the water and provide direct access to the shore. Then aquatic plants (those in the water) are removed to open up areas for docks and swimming. This essentially removes a large portion of the soil’s structural support system.\nIf you think of the soil as concrete, the root systems of plants are comparable to the rebar latticework placed by masons to reinforce the cement. Take all that away, and you open up your shoreline to erosional forces and even collapse. Not a good situation.\n\n\nIncreasing the Amount of Impervious Surfaces\nThe copious amounts of water are another serious issue. Increased development around bodies of water has led to a considerable spike in the number of impervious surfaces. These areas, such as paved driveways, parking lots, and roads, do not allow water to seep into the ground during storm events. Instead, mass amounts of water combine and run off into the water, carrying soil with it."

    "text": "System-Wide Effects\nShoreline degradation is harmful to landowners, the water, and the plants and animals that occupy these areas. Increases in soil erosion cause a dramatic influx of minerals and nutrients into waterways. Now you might be thinking this is a good thing. Pedialyte for the plants to grow big and strong, right? While some nutrients in this runoff promote plant growth, the issue lies in volumes being emptied into the water.\n\nEutrophication\nPlants and other photosynthesizing organisms are limited by certain chemicals, namely nitrogen and phosphorus. Accelerated runoff introduces these chemicals at an unnatural rate. Once this happens, a process known as eutrophication is sure to follow.\nThe immediate release of nutrients in runoff allows plants and algae to grow prolifically. Large sheets of algae then cover the entire surface of the water. Since this prevents the sun’s rays from penetrating the surface, most submergent plants cannot photosynthesize. Over time, the plants produce less and less oxygen. This leads to a poor supply of dissolved oxygen available for aquatic invertebrates and fish.\n\n\nIncreased Turbidity\nEven when eutrophication does not occur, the rapidly eroding soil makes the water more turbid (cloudy). This increase in suspended particles blocks the sun’s rays from getting to aquatic plants under the water. The same negative result as before."

    "text": "Common Solutions\nSpend any amount of time on a developed lake, and you will get an idea of how many waterfront property owners choose to protect their shorelines. Rip-rap and seawalls.\nThese two methods are often promoted heavily by contractors as the only available option to protect your shoreline. Both of these approaches do have some applicability in some situations. However, it would be in your and your ecosystem’s best interest to consider these options only as a last resort.\n\nRip-Rap\nRiprap is a technique that uses loose angular rock to stabilize slopes and protect shorelines from wave action. Rip-rap removes and prevents most plant life at the initial 10 to 20 feet of your shoreline. This functionally eliminates all the quality habitats for fish, wildlife, and invertebrates in this range.\n\n\nSeawalls\nSeawalls are large barriers, typically constructed of concrete, positioned between the shore and the water to block waves from contacting the coast. Seawalls likewise remove essential habitats but have additional impacts.\nIn many cases, seawalls actually increase the amount of erosion. When waves hit the wall, they are generally reflected laterally and downward. This movement causes the scouring of sediment in front of the seawall and also pushes water towards surrounding properties. Essentially, seawalls only protect the shoreline immediately behind them. Which is not a viable solution when thinking about shorelines along an entire water system."

    "section": "Natural Solutions",
    "text": "Natural Solutions\nIf we want to preserve the biological integrity and health of our aquatic systems, we need to re-think how we build along our shorelines. The best way to begin is to picture how an undeveloped shoreline would look…\nPlants sprawled from the water’s edge to above the high water mark on the shore. The uneven structure of vegetation and fallen branches almost make it appear messy. Damselflies, turtles, and frogs abound. Fish darting from shady log to shady log. — That’s the goal.\nSo you might be wondering, can I mimic a natural shoreline while maintaining a good aesthetic? Yes, you definitely can! Let us discuss the solutions of how to protect your shoreline naturally.\n\nSolution #1: Use Native Plants to Improve Shoreline Integrity\nUsing native plants to act as a buffer between land and water is an excellent method to help reduce erosional forces and pollution. The key to making these plants effective is placing them in suitable areas and arrangements.\nTake some time to research how each species grows and how deep its roots typically go. Look for plants that will establish while fully saturated and some that will do well along the bank. Like other native plantings, shoreline plants will generally take 1-5 years to fully mature and form a stable root arrangement.\n\n\nSolution #2: Install Coir Logs to Encourage Plant Establishment\nCoir, a biodegradable fiber made from the outer husks of coconuts, makes an excellent material to use near and in water. Placing natural coir logs along your shoreline protects the sediment from wave action. Coir logs are strong enough to stand up against years of wave action and the occasional storm if installed correctly. There is no risk of potential chemical contamination, and the fiber will break down after just 2 to 5 years.\n\n\nSolution #3: Place Erosion Control Fabric to Stabilize Bank\nErosion control fabric is a type of geotextile material that is used to stabilize soil and prevent erosion on slopes and banks. These sheets of fabric are made of natural materials, such as coconut fiber or jute, and are designed to hold the soil in place while allowing water to pass through.\nErosion control fabric comes into play when dealing with any slope of the bank. This is usually slopes of at least 3:1 (3 feet of horizontal distance for every 1 foot of vertical drop). You should also consider the type of soil and vegetation that are present at the site, as well as the climate and weather conditions.\nTo install erosion control fabric, you will need to clear any taller vegetation or debris from the site and lay the fabric over the slope. The fabric should be secured to the ground using stakes or grass plugs, which will help to anchor it in place. You can then plant grass or other vegetation on top of the fabric to help hold it in place and provide additional structure to the soil.\nErosion control fabric is a simple and effective solution for stabilizing banks and preventing erosion. It is durable and long-lasting, and can help to protect your property from the damaging effects of water and wind erosion.\n\n\nSolution #4: Slow Down Water Flow Using Rain Gardens\nRain gardens are designed to mimic the natural hydrology of a site and can be an effective tool for slowing down the flow of water and reducing soil erosion. They work by collecting and temporarily storing excess rainwater, allowing it to infiltrate into the soil rather than running off the surface. Rain gardens can be used to manage runoff from a variety of sources, including roofs, driveways, and sidewalks.\nTo create a rain garden, you will need to select a site that is located in a low-lying area of your yard and has good drainage. The garden should be at least 10 feet away from the foundation of your home and any other structures. The size and shape of the garden will depend on the amount of runoff that you are trying to manage and the slope of the site. You should also choose plants that are well-suited to your region and don’t mind having their roots intermittently wet.\nRain gardens can provide a number of benefits in addition to slowing down water flow and reducing soil erosion. They can also help to improve water quality by filtering pollutants from runoff, provide habitat for wildlife, and add beauty to your yard. Overall, rain gardens can be an effective and sustainable solution for managing water runoff and protecting your yard from erosion."

    "section": "Getting Started",
    "text": "Getting Started\nWith a bit of guidance, you can continue your path to becoming a contemporary naturalist. The following action items will help you along this journey as you learn about and connect more with nature.\n\nLearn common bird calls around your neighborhood.\nMany birds enjoy making their presence known through song. This allows us to identify individuals down to the species without laying eyes on them. Common birds, like the American robin (Turdus migratorius), can usually be heard readily in most yards. Why not just learn how to identify them by sight? Well, that’s certainly something to work on too, but oftentimes you will only be able to hear the birds and not see them. This is especially true for birds that spend most of their time in the tree canopy.\n\n\n\nAlong with a keen ear, a good set of binoculars are an excellent compliment when birding.\n\n\nThere are countless ways to begin learning the different sounds and songs of these species. One of my favorite ways is by playing games on Larkwire, an app for mastering bird sounds and visual identification. There is a whole set of common bird songs you can access for free, while more advanced ones can be purchased as add-ons inside the app. The popular eBird mobile app can also help you identify birds by simply recording their songs. The app will automatically search the eBird sound database and return suggested IDs. I am also a huge fan of surfing YouTube to find videos on bird identification.\n\n\nDiscover and explore your watershed.\nEvery location on land, including where you live and work, is part of a watershed. These large swaths of land funnel a large portion of available water to an outlet, such as a stream or bay. One way I think of it is that every drop of water is just trying to get back to the ocean. Take some time to identify the boundaries of your watershed (this USGS tool can help you with that). Remember, a single property might even be within multiple watersheds.\nExploring your watershed both on the ground and via maps can give you a complete view. Think about what goes on throughout this area and whether you would like to be downstream of it. As you can imagine, local influences have a collective effect along this pathway, whether positive or negative. This snowballing potential is the exact reason why land managers need to think on a landscape scale. It also highlights the importance of entire community conservation efforts.\n\n\nUse mobile apps to explore nature around you.\nWhether you are ordering pizza or trying to identify an unknown plant, there is an app out there for you. Most popular apps are available on both iOS and Android, so accessing them should not be much trouble. Some even have the ability to download content for offline use, so you can still use the app while away from cell service.\n\n\n\nMany apps provide ways of capturing data offline, then uploading once connected again.\n\n\nThe following apps are some of my favorites when it comes to recording nature observations and getting help with an ID.\n\niNaturalist — a social network for sharing biodiversity information with other naturalists in your region and conservation scientists around the world. iNaturalist can help you identify unknown plants and animals through AI image recognition and a community of contributors.\nMerlin Bird ID — helps you identify birds you see and hear by referencing data on eBird, the world’s largest database of bird sightings, sounds, and photos. Merlin Bird ID can use deep learning to provide ID suggestions based on photos and sound recordings.\neBird Mobile — allows you to record your bird observations while in the field and link those records to their worldwide database for you and scientists to reference. eBird Mobile allows you to build checklists based on your location and includes scientific and common names for birds around the world.\nNature’s Notebook — a program for observing and recording plant and animal life cycle events, like flowering and bird migration. Nature’s Notebook connects your observations to the databases of the USA National Phenology Network.\n\n\n\nCollect and identify local plants electronically.\nThe wealth of plant diversity is mind-blowing when you first set off. It can be hard to imagine how anyone might begin exploring this world of wonderment. While some choose to dive straight into the plant taxonomy literature, that might lead to jargon overload and eventual dismissal. I usually suggest that folks start with a general survey of the plants around them.\nTake a walk through your property or local natural area and stop if you see a plant you are not familiar with. Examine how the specimen is positioned in its surroundings and what the conditions are where it is growing. If local laws and regulations allow you to do so, consider collecting this plant so you can examine it once you are out of the field. In some situations, it might be preferable to collect the plant digitally via your cell phone. Consider using an app like iNaturalist to submit a new record, or simply take several photos of the plant to reference later on.\nNote: Many natural areas, state parks, and other designations have specific laws preventing the collection of plant material without the proper permit, so be sure to check with local authorities before heading into the field.\n\n\nRead nature books and ecology articles.\nThere are lots of high-quality ecology books out there. Some writings can be technical, while others are on the light reading side. I try to include a good mixture of both throughout my reading selection. If you are just beginning your naturalist journey, consider reading introductory texts or flipping through a descriptive field guide.\nRemember that building with all the books in it? You should really take advantage of your local library resources! I did a quick search on the website of my library for ecology and it returned over fifty books on the subject. Librarians are also some of the best people in the world and can often point you in the right direction.\nThere are also thousands of free online books on conservation, ecology, and many other topics. Most of these are publications put out by research groups or universities across the country. A simple web search of “topic + filetype:pdf” will usually provide you with some nice options to peruse.\n\n\nVolunteer for a local nonprofit conservation group.\nEnjoy doing great work for nature? Great to hear! Local conservation groups need dedicated people like you to achieve their missions. Land trusts, natural study societies, conservation organizations, and many other groups rely on support from local citizens to keep their entities running.\nIt’s not all pulling weeds and applying herbicide either. Fundraising, clerical work, social media content creation, website maintenance, education, and bookkeeping are the common tasks needed by many organizations.\n\n\nTake a master naturalist class.\nCommunity education classes, like the Master Naturalist program, are a perfect way to gain exposure to different science topics. These programs typically operate out of University extension offices in cooperation with other organizations and focus on conservation education.\nCommunity education classes are both an excellent way to learn about nature and meet like-minded conservationists in your neighborhood. Participants learn about the ecology of their local environment and the importance of protecting biodiversity. They also get the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the natural world, through hands-on field trips and activities.\n\n\nLook through threatened and endangered species lists.\nMost states and regions have a designated list of threatened and endangered (T&E) resources. Most can be found online through your state’s natural resources agency. These lists are not something a species wants to be on. Inclusion typically means that local levels for that species or subspecies are way lower than they should be to maintain a healthy population.\nLearning about T&E species in your area can be pretty eye-opening. Even we biologists need to brief ourselves occasionally on new species of concern. Find a listed species you do not know much about, then research the known life history and reason(s) for listing. More often than not, the two are linked. Look into the primary threats and how to mitigate them."
