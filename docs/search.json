    "section": "My Interests",
    "text": "My Interests\nMy professional interests are at the intersection of geospatial and ecological science, particularly projects using GIS to inform conservation efforts.\n\nApplied Conservation Science — My work aims to inform on-the-ground management and decisions through applied research in conservation.\nSpatial and Movement Ecology — I am fascinated by all aspects of wildlife space use, resource selection, and spatial ecology.\nImperiled Species Conservation — Our most imperiled species need immediate attention and sound science to support recovery and protection efforts.\nLandscape Connectivity & Planning — Much of my interest in GIS relates to the use of those technologies for researching the ecological relationships of species and the landscape.\nWeb and Cartographic Design — My passion for web and cartographic design satisfies my artistic inclination, whether I’m delving into the intricacies of CSS code for a website or honing my skills in crafting visually appealing and effective map designs.\nOpen Source Programming — While I also use proprietary software, I am a big proponent of using and supporting open source projects like Posit and QGIS."
