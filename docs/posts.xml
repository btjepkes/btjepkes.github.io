<p>In the code above, we start by installing and loading the quarto package. Then, we load the birdfeeder visitation data from a CSV file. Next, we define the parameters for our report, such as the report title and the desired date range for filtering the data.</p>
<p>We create a Quarto document using the quarto_document() function, specifying the input R Markdown file, report title, parameter list, and desired output format (in this case, HTML). We then use the quarto_chunk() and quarto_code() functions to add code chunks to our document.</p>
<p>The code chunks contain R code for filtering the data based on the specified date range and creating a line plot using ggplot2. Finally, we save the generated plot as a PNG file using ggsave().</p>

<section id="in-conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>By leveraging Quarto and its capabilities for reproducible reporting, you can transform your reporting workflow from manual and error-prone to automated and efficient. Parameterizing reports allows you to easily update and regenerate them based on changing data or analysis requirements.</p>
<p>Reproducible documents not only save time but also enhance collaboration and ensure the accuracy and integrity of your reports. Give Quarto a try in the RStudio environment and experience the power of streamlining your reporting workflow.</p>
<p>Start producing reproducible documents today and say goodbye to the hassles of manual report updates!</p>
<p>Happy reporting with Quarto!</p>

<p>Let’s first run through the species of focus and the data sources for this post.</p>
<section id="focal-species" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="focal-species">Focal Species</h3>
<p>The Greater sage grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>) is a chicken-like bird native to portions of the western United States. They are an important species for the ecosystems they inhabit by playing a key role in controlling insect populations and serving as a food source for predators (e.g., eagles, coyotes).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="img-sage-grouse.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Greater sage grouse at lek. Photo: Pat Hnilicka/USFWS" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://btjepkes.github.io/posts/img-sage-grouse.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></a></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Greater sage grouse at lek. Photo: Pat Hnilicka/USFWS</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Sage grouse populations have declined in recent years due to habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to conservation efforts and protections being put in place to help preserve the species. Mapping where these birds have been located in recent years can show us just how much their distribution has been restricted when compared to their historic range.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources">Data Sources</h3>
<p>Today, we will pull records of sage grouse occurrences from the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a>. GBIF is a database of species occurrence records from sources all over the globe. <code>rgbif</code>is an r package that allows us to interface with the GBIF API. It includes functions for searching for taxonomic names, retrieving information on data providers, getting species occurrence records, getting counts of occurrence records, and using the GBIF tile map service to make rasters summarizing huge amounts of data.</p>

<p>Our first task is to prepare our RStudio work space by installing and/or loading the necessary packages. All of these are available through CRAN and can be installed through the <code>install.packages()</code> function.</p>

<section id="the-spatial-revolution-is-now" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-spatial-revolution-is-now">The Spatial Revolution Is Now</h2>
<p>Advancements in geospatial technologies are revolutionizing the field of wildlife research and conservation, providing new and innovative ways to collect and analyze data. Among these technologies, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the spatial relationships between wildlife, their habitat, and the environment in which they live. By combining maps and other location-based tools, GIS can help conservationists and biologists make informed decisions and take targeted actions to preserve biodiversity and protect threatened species.</p>
<section id="what-is-gis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-gis">What is GIS?</h3>
<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a technology that enables the collection, management, analysis, and visualization of spatial data. Essentially, it’s a computer-based tool that allows users to create and work with maps and other location-based data. It can range from desktop GIS software used to design maps to GPS-enabled mobile devices that collect location information of physical objects in the field.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-components" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-components">What are the components?</h3>
<p>Sometimes it can be helpful to discuss GIS in the terms of its discrete elements, which all work together to form the system. These components include hardware, software, data, and people.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>hardware component</strong> of GIS typically includes GPS receivers and other mobile devices that can be used to collect spatial data in the field. For example, biologists might use GPS-equipped collars to track the movements of individual animals, or drones to map remote and inaccessible terrain.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>software component</strong> of GIS encompasses a variety of tools for processing and analyzing spatial data. Some of the most popular GIS software programs include ArcGIS, QGIS, and Google Earth. These programs allow users to create maps, perform spatial analysis, and visualize data in a variety of ways. They can also integrate data from a range of sources, including satellite imagery, aerial photography, and field surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>data component</strong> of GIS includes a vast array of information, from digital maps and satellite imagery to climate data and biological inventories. To be useful, this data must be organized, standardized, and stored in a way that can be easily accessed and analyzed by GIS software.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the <strong>people component</strong> of GIS includes the scientists, technicians, and other professionals who use the technology to collect, manage, and interpret spatial data. These people have the expertise to collect, organize, and present spatial data accurately and in accordance with project goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the right combination of hardware, software, data, and expertise, GIS can be an incredibly powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the natural world and developing effective conservation strategies.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-general-applications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-general-applications">What are the general applications?</h3>
<p>GIS has numerous applications, from helping urban planners optimize city layouts to assisting epidemiologists in tracking disease outbreaks. With its adaptive and always-evolving set of tools, GIS is beneficial to an unlimited number of occupations, including these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Analysis</li>
<li>Landscape and Civil Engineering</li>
<li>Watershed Management</li>
<li>Land Surveying</li>
<li>Emergency Management</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of wildlife research and conservation, GIS is a powerful tool that allows scientists to gain insights into the spatial relationships between different ecological variables, such as habitat types, climate patterns, and animal movements.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="providing-solutions-to-study-wildlife" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="providing-solutions-to-study-wildlife">Providing Solutions to Study Wildlife</h2>
<p>Geographic information systems (GIS) have revolutionized wildlife research by providing tools to manage, analyze, and visualize spatial data. <strong>Here are four ways wildlife researchers use GIS to study wildlife and their habitats:</strong></p>
<section id="surveying-wildlife" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surveying-wildlife">#1 - Surveying wildlife</h3>
<p>One of the main aims of biologists that need to manage wildlife populations is getting an estimate of density (i.e., animals per unit area), sex ratio (i.e., number of females vs.&nbsp;number of males), and age structure (i.e., the distribution of age classes within a population).</p>
<p>Population metrics like these and many others are often the result of data collected during field surveys, where biologists count the number of individuals they see or hear along a specified survey route (in most cases). GIS technologies, like those discussed in the below video, are used by biologists to navigate and collect data during surveys.</p>
</section>
<section id="habitat-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="habitat-analysis">#2 - Habitat analysis</h3>
<p>GIS can be used to map and analyze wildlife habitat by collecting data on environmental variables that have been supported by studies to impact the use of that area by wildlife. These metrics could include habitat elements like vegetation type, topographic features, water availability, and other factors that influence habitat quality. This information helps researchers understand the spatial distribution of wildlife species and identify areas that may be important for conservation.</p>
<p>The mapping capabilities of GIS allow researchers to understand the impact of humans on wildlife, especially when it comes to the fragmentation and reduction of habitat. By mapping and analyzing the size, shape, and connectivity of different habitat patches, they can identify areas where habitat fragmentation is a problem and develop strategies to address it.</p>
</section>
<section id="movement-patterns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="movement-patterns">#3 - Movement patterns</h3>
<p>When it is safe and ethical to do so, biologists can track the movements of wildlife through GPS collars or other tracking devices. By mapping these movement patterns, researchers can understand their behavior and use that knowledge to better manage populations and habitats.</p>
<p>Biologists use GIS to create models of animal movement, which can help them understand how animals use different habitats and how they move across the landscape. These models combine data on animal behavior, habitat characteristics, and environmental variables. This can be used to identify areas where animals are most likely to be found, as well as areas where targeted conservation efforts would be fruitful.</p>
</section>
<section id="disease-mapping" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disease-mapping">#4 - Disease mapping</h3>
<p>Wildlife disease ecologists use GIS to track the spread of diseases within and among wildlife populations. Spatial analysis tools are used within a GIS to identify disease hotspots, clustering, and spatial trends. By mapping disease outbreaks and analyzing the spatial patterns of infections, researchers can identify areas that may be at high risk and develop targeted interventions to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
<p>GIS can also be used to model the spread of diseases in wildlife populations. By simulating the movement of animals across the landscape and the transmission of the disease, researchers can predict the likelihood and spread of disease outbreaks. This allows wildlife managers to control the spread of certain diseases by targeting certain high-risk areas.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GIS is an extraordinary technology that most people benefit from without even knowing. With all the advances being made in different sensors, batteries, and computational processing power, the capabilities of these systems will only just start to be realized.</p>
<p>Until next time, Ben</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="naturalists-of-today" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naturalists-of-today">Naturalists of Today</h2>
<p>Everyone has an inherent connection to nature. You might not recognize it without intentionally looking for it, but it is there. While some venture into a science career and dedicate much of their time to seeking a better understanding of the natural world, not everyone needs to do so. Furthering your appreciation and understanding for the environment can be simple, fun, and worthwhile.</p>
<section id="are-naturalists-still-around" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-naturalists-still-around">Are naturalists still around?</h3>
<p>Contemporary naturalists are individuals who are interested in exploring and studying the natural world around them. The focus could be any aspect of nature, such as plants, animals, or general environmental awareness. Whether you are a scientist, a hobbyist, or simply someone who loves being outside, there are many ways you can become a contemporary naturalist.</p>
</section>
<section id="can-i-become-a-naturalist" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-i-become-a-naturalist">Can I become a naturalist?</h3>
<p>It is easier than ever to get involved in conservation today. International travel is not required to make an impact worldwide. There is also plenty to be done right in your community. You don’t need a fancy college degree to discuss ecological topics. Nor do you need to be independently wealthy, as much can be done for free, at very little cost, or for just a snippet of your time.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="getting-started" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>With a bit of guidance, you can continue your path to becoming a contemporary naturalist. The following action items will help you along this journey as you learn about and connect more with nature.</p>
<section id="learn-common-bird-calls-around-your-neighborhood." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learn-common-bird-calls-around-your-neighborhood.">Learn common bird calls around your neighborhood.</h3>
<p>Many birds enjoy making their presence known through song. This allows us to identify individuals down to the species without laying eyes on them. Common birds, like the American robin (Turdus migratorius), can usually be heard readily in most yards. Why not just learn how to identify them by sight? Well, that’s certainly something to work on too, but oftentimes you will only be able to hear the birds and not see them. This is especially true for birds that spend most of their time in the tree canopy.</p>
<p>There are countless ways to begin learning the different sounds and songs of these species. One of my favorite ways is by playing games on Larkwire, an app for mastering bird sounds and visual identification. There is a whole set of common bird songs you can access for free, while more advanced ones can be purchased as add-ons inside the app. The popular eBird mobile app can also help you identify birds by simply recording their songs. The app will automatically search the eBird sound database and return suggested IDs. I am also a huge fan of surfing YouTube to find videos on bird identification.</p>
</section>
<section id="discover-and-explore-your-watershed." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discover-and-explore-your-watershed.">Discover and explore your watershed.</h3>
<p>Every location on land, including where you live and work, is part of a watershed. These large swaths of land funnel a large portion of available water to an outlet, such as a stream or bay. One way I think of it is that every drop of water is just trying to get back to the ocean. Take some time to identify the boundaries of your watershed (this USGS tool can help you with that). Remember, a single property might even be within multiple watersheds.</p>
<p>Exploring your watershed both on the ground and via maps can give you a complete view. Think about what goes on throughout this area and whether you would like to be downstream of it. As you can imagine, local influences have a collective effect along this pathway, whether positive or negative. This snowballing potential is the exact reason why land managers need to think on a landscape scale. It also highlights the importance of entire community conservation efforts.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-mobile-apps-to-explore-nature-around-you." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-mobile-apps-to-explore-nature-around-you.">Use mobile apps to explore nature around you.</h3>
<p>Whether you are ordering pizza or trying to identify an unknown plant, there is an app out there for you. Most popular apps are available on both iOS and Android, so accessing them should not be much trouble. Some even have the ability to download content for offline use, so you can still use the app while away from cell service.</p>
<p>The following apps are some of my favorites when it comes to recording nature observations and getting help with an ID.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iNaturalist</strong> — a social network for sharing biodiversity information with other naturalists in your region and conservation scientists around the world. iNaturalist can help you identify unknown plants and animals through AI image recognition and a community of contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Merlin Bird ID</strong> — helps you identify birds you see and hear by referencing data on eBird, the world’s largest database of bird sightings, sounds, and photos. Merlin Bird ID can use deep learning to provide ID suggestions based on photos and sound recordings.</li>
<li><strong>eBird Mobile</strong> — allows you to record your bird observations while in the field and link those records to their worldwide database for you and scientists to reference. eBird Mobile allows you to build checklists based on your location and includes scientific and common names for birds around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Nature’s Notebook</strong> — a program for observing and recording plant and animal life cycle events, like flowering and bird migration. Nature’s Notebook connects your observations to the databases of the USA National Phenology Network.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="collect-and-identify-local-plants-electronically." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collect-and-identify-local-plants-electronically.">Collect and identify local plants electronically.</h3>
<p>The wealth of plant diversity is mind-blowing when you first set off. It can be hard to imagine how anyone might begin exploring this world of wonderment. While some choose to dive straight into the plant taxonomy literature, that might lead to jargon overload and eventual dismissal. I usually suggest that folks start with a general survey of the plants around them.</p>
<p>Take a walk through your property or local natural area and stop if you see a plant you are not familiar with. Examine how the specimen is positioned in its surroundings and what the conditions are where it is growing. If local laws and regulations allow you to do so, consider collecting this plant so you can examine it once you are out of the field. In some situations, it might be preferable to collect the plant digitally via your cell phone. Consider using an app like iNaturalist to submit a new record, or simply take several photos of the plant to reference later on.</p>
<p><em>Note: Many natural areas, state parks, and other designations have specific laws preventing the collection of plant material without the proper permit, so be sure to check with local authorities before heading into the field.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="read-nature-books-and-ecology-articles." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="read-nature-books-and-ecology-articles.">Read nature books and ecology articles.</h3>
<p>There are lots of high-quality ecology books out there. Some writings can be technical, while others are on the light reading side. I try to include a good mixture of both throughout my reading selection. If you are just beginning your naturalist journey, consider reading introductory texts or flipping through a descriptive field guide.</p>
<p>Remember that building with all the books in it? You should really take advantage of your local library resources! I did a quick search on the website of my library for ecology and it returned over fifty books on the subject. Librarians are also some of the best people in the world and can often point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>There are also thousands of free online books on conservation, ecology, and many other topics. Most of these are publications put out by research groups or universities across the country. A simple web search of “topic + filetype:pdf” will usually provide you with some nice options to peruse.</p>
</section>
<section id="volunteer-for-a-local-nonprofit-conservation-group." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="volunteer-for-a-local-nonprofit-conservation-group.">Volunteer for a local nonprofit conservation group.</h3>
<p>Enjoy doing great work for nature? Great to hear! Local conservation groups need dedicated people like you to achieve their missions. Land trusts, natural study societies, conservation organizations, and many other groups rely on support from local citizens to keep their entities running.</p>
<p>It’s not all pulling weeds and applying herbicide either. Fundraising, clerical work, social media content creation, website maintenance, education, and bookkeeping are the common tasks needed by many organizations.</p>
</section>
<section id="take-a-master-naturalist-class." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-a-master-naturalist-class.">Take a master naturalist class.</h3>
<p>Community education classes, like the Master Naturalist program, are a perfect way to gain exposure to different science topics. These programs typically operate out of University extension offices in cooperation with other organizations and focus on conservation education.</p>
<p>Community education classes are both an excellent way to learn about nature and meet like-minded conservationists in your neighborhood. Participants learn about the ecology of their local environment and the importance of protecting biodiversity. They also get the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the natural world, through hands-on field trips and activities.</p>
</section>
<section id="look-through-threatened-and-endangered-species-lists." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="look-through-threatened-and-endangered-species-lists.">Look through threatened and endangered species lists.</h3>
<p>Most states and regions have a designated list of threatened and endangered (T&amp;E) resources. Most can be found online through your state’s natural resources agency. These lists are not something a species wants to be on. Inclusion typically means that local levels for that species or subspecies are way lower than they should be to maintain a healthy population.</p>
<p>Learning about T&amp;E species in your area can be pretty eye-opening. Even we biologists need to brief ourselves occasionally on new species of concern. Find a listed species you do not know much about, then research the known life history and reason(s) for listing. More often than not, the two are linked. Look into the primary threats and how to mitigate them.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>While this is neither a required list nor a comprehensive one, I hope you are able to try some of these activities and begin to share them with family and friends. I happily welcome comments from readers with more suggestions.</p>
<p>Until next time, Ben</p>
